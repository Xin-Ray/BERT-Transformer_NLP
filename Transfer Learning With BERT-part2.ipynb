( a friend of mine once came up with a rule of thumb about movie characters : \" if no one in the movie behaves like anyone you know , or would * care * to know , just leave ! \" ) one of the nastier things about the movie is the way it treats lesbianism not as an integral part of someone \\' s life , but as a kind of kink -- something to thrill men with . i despair whenever i encounter this kind of stupidity in mainstream entertainment ; are we still so culturally neanderthal that the only way to include something like that in a big - budget hollywood film is as a hefnerism ?',\n",

              " ('while watching wes anderson \\' s rushmore , it may be surprising to think that the role of max fischer , the film \\' s anti - hero , was not written with jason schwartzman in mind . the young actor , making his film debut as a 15 year old student at the exclusive rushmore academy is so perfect in the role that it comes as a shock that anderson auditioned some two thousand other prospective stars before discovering schwarztman . schwartzman plays max , a student who is more interested in his extra - curricular activities ( such as writing edgy plays like \" serpico \" and being president of the rushmore beekeepers ) but sees his grades suffer as a result . on the brink of being thrown out , he lands himself in even more hot water when he falls for first grade teacher rosemary cross ( olivia williams ) and enlists the help of millionaire acquaintance herman blume ( the great bill murray ) to build an aquarium ( on rushmore \\' s baseball field ) in her honour . unfortunately for everyone involved , blume finds that he has feelings for miss cross as well , which gets in the way of max \\' s plans to woo her . max is one of the best - written characters we \\' ve yet seen in the 90s , and schwartzman plays him to perfection in one of the finest comedy performances ever given by someone of his age . as everyone else has probably already pointed out , he is reminiscent of a young dustin hoffman ( although i was reminded more of paul from \" the wonder years \" , from a visual standpoint , at least ) . hopefully , if he avoids typecasting as weird , quirky loner - types he should earn himself a good career . bill murray is his equal as blume , displaying a depth we haven \\' t yet seen from him . while this isn \\' t his best performance ( that honour goes to groundhog day ) he is still terrific here . williams isn \\' t given much to do except react to schwartzman and murray , but still does fine work . rushmore seems to go just a little too long but , while it isn \\' t a perfect film , it is a definate must - see for anyone who wants to see that rarity , an american coming - of - age film that actually works well without an excessive amount of sentimentality . anderson has created a modern classic with a star who should , with any luck , rise to even greater success .',\n",

the most glaring consequence of this one - eyed stupidity is a hopelessly jumpy narrative , leaving us with badly underdeveloped characters . thus their personalities are vague , their motivations unclear and , in the case of paul \\' s father duke leto , their demise rather meaningless . the end result is a distinct chill : we can \\' t warm to most of the cast and we don \\' t care much for them . and it hardly helps that the voice - over narration is sparse and that the dune - esque language and terminology sounds like so much gobbledegook to those unfamiliar with the book . dune is also a very serous film . the constant \" self - talk \" by various characters makes it so serious and self - absorbed at times that you may find it hard not to wince with embarrassment . the overall impression is a world full of people so intense that no one is allowed a joke lest the universe come crashing down around them . humour - or at least a gentle kind of humour as distinct from the harkonnen \\' s mad , sadistic kind - is hard to find . you may balk at the comparison , but as a writer lynch could well have done with some lessons from george lucus \\' star wars trilogy . the theatrical version is still some way from being a complete disaster , however . it still possesses enough of lynch \\' s stylistic quirks and enough visual invention to sustain the interest of viewers with a taste for imaginative sci - fi . special effects whiz carlo rambaldi \\' s giant sandworms are an awesome sight . both the production design ( anthony masters ) and costume design ( bob ringwood ) are striking and original . and the magnificent score by toto and brian eno is one of the most underrated soundtracks of the last twenty years . with these elements in place and the benefit of freddie francis \\' lush cinematography , the film is at least a feast for the senses . see it in the widescreen format if you can . and despite all the cuts , several cast members still make a strong impression , most notably kenneth mcmillan as the supremely nasty baron vladimir harkonnen . sian phillips also registers strongly as the reverend mother gaius helen mohiam , leader of the bene gesserit religious order who \\' s secret aim is to manipulate paul \\' s destiny for its own shadowy ends . as paul atreides , the young kyle maclachlan starts off somewhat shakily , but as his character grows in strength so does his performance and he emerges as a credible leader of the fremen crusade . the conclusion ? any assessment of this film must take into account that frank herbert \\' s original novel is a complex piece of work and presents a tough challenge for any filmmaker . david lynch took a brave stab at it and , partly due to forces beyond his control , ended up with an officially released version that fails in several key respects . dune certainly confused and frustrated a lot of people on its release . many chose to stay away altogether , as the film \\' s disastrous box office showing attests . the extended version , however , is a rather different beast . in 1984 lynch stated his intention to release his own special edition \" director \\' s cut \" of the film on home video , a clear indication of his dissatisfaction with the version that ended up in the theatres . but , alas , he failed to do so , choosing to move on to other projects . in a way , then , it is partly lynch \\' s own fault that what appeared instead was an unauthorised extended version , put together in 1988 by mca tv special projects for airing on cable networks in the usa . stung into action , lynch successfully petitioned the director \\' s guild to take his name off the credits and replace it with \" allen smithee \" , the standard pseudonym for directors who wish to disown their own work . he also had the screenwriting credit changed to the anonymous \" judas booth \" . certainly , looking at the results of mca \\' s handiwork there \\' s at least half a dozen instances that , for sheer technical sloppiness , are good enough reasons for the director to object . but these gripes must be considered in light of the improvements that the extended cut of dune offers in several crucial areas . most of the changes involve the restoration or extension of cut scenes and the addition of extra narration , both of which fill many holes in the original version \\' s storyline . paul \\' s relationship with his father and associates is more intimate , with moments of humour and warmth lacking previously . the political skulduggery involving the emperor , the spacing guild , the bene gesserits and the two warring houses is far better explained . paul \\' s initiation into the fremen way of life on arrakis is also fleshed out considerably . and as further background , a new prologue has been added featuring narration and painted stills to give us a brief history of the dune universe . as a piece of storytelling , then , mca tv \\' s version of dune is clearly superior . as a piece of editing , however , it is at times surprisingly inept . the use of painted stills in the new prologue works well enough , but their occasional appearance once the action begins is inappropriate . there \\' s some sloppy cutting , too , and in a few instances shots even appear out of order . and the use of repeated footage to fabricate certain scenes ( eg . ships coming and going , soldiers coming and going ) is at times clearly out - of - context . this is the kind of thing to which lynch objected , and rightly so . it should also be noted that several questionable scenes and shots from the theatrical version were deleted to satisfy the censorship demands of u . s . television . but the most notable omission is a gratuitous piece of nonsense from lynch that wasn \\' t even in herbert \\' s book . the scene features baron harkonnen killing a beautiful young man in front of his slobbering henchmen by pulling out his \" heart plug \" . its a surreal and disturbing episode that \\' s very lynch - esque but adds nothing to what we already know : the baron is a nasty piece of work . despite its own peculiar flaws , then , the extended version of dune is a generally superior film . all up , it contains 35 minutes of restored footage and approximately another 15 minutes of either altered , fabricated or newly created sequences . unless the idiosyncratic lynch has a sudden change of heart , the \" alan smithee \" version remains the closest we \\' ll get to what the movie should have been . on repeated viewings , one suspects it is closer than what lynch would be prepared to admit . still , as one of this century \\' s great science - fiction novels , some fans and perhaps the late herbert himself would argue that dune deserved a better fate in its transfer to the screen . with rumours circulating of a new six hour mini - series planned by production company new amsterdam entertainment in 1998 , it is unlikely that we have heard the last of the dune saga .',\n",

              " ('as we see the terrible events that unfold before our eyes in the middle east at the moment , hollywood doesn \\' t loose the oppertunity to get involved , by telling stories and expressing opinions . this film centers on a relationship forged throughout the adult lifetimes of two marine colonels , hays hodges ( tommy lee jones ) and terry childers ( samuel l . jackson ) . they fought side by side in vietnam , where childers saved hodges \\' life by shooting an unarmed pow . that \\' s against the rules of war but understandable , in this story anyway , under the specific circumstances . certainly hodges is not complaining . years pass . hodges , whose wounds make him unfit for action , gets a law degree and becomes a marine lawyer . childers , is now a respected and much - decorated hero that has served his country with his life and sould . because of his excellent record , childers is sent to yemen to rescue the american ambassador ( ben kingsley ) , cowering in the embassy under assault from violent demonstrators and snipers blasting from rooftops . childers does what he has to do : evacuate the family and protect the men under his command . after three marines die and the colonel thinks he sees ground fire , he orders his troops to shoot into the firing crowd . more than 80 yemeni men , women , and children are mowed down . childers is immediately accused of ordering his men to fire on a crowd and murder of unarmed civilians . he persuades his old friend hodges to represent him in the courtroom drama that occupies the second half of the film . did childers violate authorized u . s . military rules of engagement ? or are there simply no rules in war ? the answers to these stereotypical questions are obvious , but the inconsistent plot immediately raises all sorts of other questions . the murder of 83 \" innocent civilians \" has to result into something greater than a simple trial in the u . s . where is the accusations from the arab leaders ? where is the u . n . ? the film ends without even telling the most interesting story : what happens on the international arena ? this film ( in a way akin to films such as \" a few good men \" ) has already been accused of breaking the rules of morality and ethics and even of racism . these accusations are pretty heavy , but also unfair . what director william friedklin truly broke was the rules of decent filmmaking . one of the earliest apparent problems with \\' rules of engagement \\' is its lack of credibility . the entire operation in yemen may remind us about what happens in the middle east right now , but is overdone , contrived and unrealistic - as if a chain of events had to happen in a particular manner in order for the plot to proceed . a lot of it is so cheesy that no one could possibly accept it as reality . that is precisely why it \\' s not offensive . it is completely unobjective . many stories are started and never finished . many questions are asked , but never answered . a lot of parallels are referring to nothing . it seems that neither the director , producers or the screenwriter can make up their minds about the contents of their film . is it about arab mentality ? america \\' s foreign policies ? america \\' s role in the world ? corruption in the higher circles ? it goes on and on . it consists of countless stories , but not a definable plot . it tries to be everything for everyone and ends up being nothing for no one . i think that it is ironic , because director william friedkin \\' s probably most acclaimed film was \" the exorcist \" which had a silly story , but became a rather effective film . in this case you have a strong story with many possibilities and the result is a silly film . though several scenes bare the mark of professionalism ( such as the impressive battle scenes ) , his latest film does simply not engage . i believe that friedklin is a director that is absolutely depended on great scripts and talented producers in order to succeed . it \\' s obvious that he has neither and the result is therefore a catastrophe . the characters feel designed , unreal , merely shadows , with no life outside the conflict . even the actors can not save this film from going under . though both jackson and jones act admirably , with performances that are as good as you get with a script like this , it is not something that these great actors can boast of . they have roles that they could play blindfolded with their hand on the back . jackson is gray and jones uninteresting . the rest of the cast , including ben kingsly , blair underwood and guy pearce are simply waiting for their paychecks . the time has come for the verdict . on the charges of complete lack of objectivity , i find this film guilty . on the charges of breaking the rules of reasonable filmmaking , i find it guilty . but on the charges of racism i find this film not guilty , because of it \\' s inconclusive and often silly plot that lacks objectivity everywhere , not only when concerning the arab population . i must admit that the film is dangerously near the line of being racially offensive and i do think that screenwriter stephen gaghan went a bit too far , portraying the yemeni people almost as stereotypical hollywood bad - guys . this is very sad , since in a time like this it is crucial to not lose objectivity and proclaim the truth . however , it is absolutely necessary to remember that the muslim terrorists are responsible for most of the terrorist activity in and outside the united states . and that it \\' s not a coincidence that u . s . residents in the middle east , including yemen are on constant maximum alert .',\n",

it sheds light on the boundaries between what is earthly and what is heavenly , and shows just how thin those boundaries are . both cage and ryan give soulful , soft - spoken performances . ryan , who is usually so bouncy and energetic , truly embodies a sadness that can only be alleviated by a heavenly touch . cage projects all his desire and longing to be human in simple , heartfelt gazes , and speaks with the comforting , knowing voice that only an angel could have . what is most striking about \" city of angels \" is that stevens has added a new ending to the screenplay , which is both unexpected and challenging . it \\' s not a formulaic hollywood ending , because it is both sad and uplifting at the same time . it doesn \\' t give the audience what it thinks it wants at the end of a romance . instead , it offers something much better , something that speaks to the depths of what it means to be human and alive . ____________________________________________ visit \" charlie don \\' t surf ! \" an eclectic collection of film reviews by james kendrick http : // www . bigfoot . com /~ jimkendrick || e - mail : jimkendrick @ bigfoot . com',\n",

( while the depiction is not biblically accurate , it is entertaining and might be excuse enough to familiarize ourselves with the true record by reading what is written in genesis 7 . ) a positive note is that the studio has avoided any segment which is as perversely dark as nihgt on bald mountain upon which the original film ended . there are some images based upon fantasy such as the flying whales in respighi ' s pines of rome or images which have their roots in mythology such as the ethereal creatures which tell the story of nature ' s cycle of life , death , and rebirth in igor stravinsky ' s firebird suite . but the stories they tell are uplifting , containing nothing too frightening for our younger children . the darkest segment , spiritually speaking , actually belongs to the only holdover from the original fantasia , mickey mouse in the sorcerer ' s apprentice by paul dukas . but overall , the emotions evoked from fantasia 2000 are positive ones , being full of hope and promise . music has an impact which can be undeniably felt , capable of leading the listener to emotional peaks and inspirational highs simply not attainable through other mediums . it is no wonder that the levites , as the priestly tribe of the old testament , were also the appointed musicians . if fantasia 2000 is able to introduce a new audience to music which inspires and exalts , it will have done an incredible service .\",\n",

' . there are more than enough jolts to send your adrenalin pumping overtime . the story in itself is not exactly something very exciting and also , the acting is only at most , average by most commercial standards . even so , the essence of horror is carried out very well in this film , thanks to its well - paced storytelling , disturbing set designs and some really gory sequences ( which incidentally , has been quite generously removed by our censorship board ) . director paul anderson ( who did mortal kombat ) and his team of ` atmosphere ' creators have done well in keeping event horizon within the bounds of the term ` horror ' . this picture did not do very well in the us box - office most probably for the dread - factor impact it has on most audiences ; people will not see it again and not many would recommend their friend to watch this . although on the face of it , event horizon is mostly molded for mass - entertainment ; many thrills , spills and suspense to keep audiences in focus . however , the offbeat horror element which it ultimately convey audiences is very disturbing . my friend and i could not say a word to each other for quite a while after going through the ` experience ' of event horizon . i guess it was just the immense feeling of dread which the film had cast upon us . be forewarned , this film is not for the faint - hearted nor for pure entertainment . be prepared to be disturbed if you should decide to watch this film ! event horizon is highly recommended ? ? but at your own risk ! it has been a long time since good - horror embraced the big screen , and event horizon is one .\",\n",

) . but one day , he finds out that it \\' s probably possible that his desires can come true in the form of a business deal brought out by a black market geneticist ( or something ) , german ( \" wings \" \\' tony shalhoub , who did like hundreds of cameos in films back in \\' 97 : \" men in black , \" \" a life less ordinary \" . . . ) , who \\' s client is a genetically perfect man , jerome morrow ( jude law ) , who has unfortunately been crippled . fortunately , though , there \\' s no record of the accident , and he \\' s willing to give someone else his life . since vincent looks a bit like him . . . after a couple alterations ( some minor , some really major ) , he has donned the life of jerome , and is doing his job . there , he meets a genetically imperfect woman , irene ( uma thurman , who \\' s genetically perfect in real life anyway , hee hee ) , and the two begin a kind of relationship , albeit a very shallow one since romance is deemed by how great a man \\' s stats are . however , a murder of a high - level worker at his office is killed , and one of vincent / jerome \\' s eyelashes is found by the anal retentive investigators headed by a semi - wily inspector , hugo , ( alan arkin ) , and none other than vincent \\' s long lost brother , anton , who hasn \\' t seen him since they were teenagers . we know vincent / jerome didn \\' t do it , but with his older picture being posted everywhere , not only vincent / jerome \\' s in trouble , but also the real jerome , who \\' s as much in it as he is . however , there isn \\' t many big suspense set pieces , which is actually a blessing because if they were tossed in , the film would lose it \\' s message and descend into just being a sci - fi thriller a la william gibson . the suspense in the film comes from the idea that vincent and jerome can easily be captured just by dropping a hair or dead skin . while there are several scenes which are pretty frightening , there are no big distractions from the point of the film , much to the dismay of commercial audiences . what is actually portrayed is the lack of life in the utopian society that is created . irene has no real spunk in her life , and is rather amazed by the sheer beauty of a sunrise rather than genetically perfect people . and the genetically flawless jerome is in actuality a bitter man , claiming that his accident was really no accident . what jerome has done is fool the system in giving a man who yearns for better things a chance at that , and the ending is shocking as it \\' s a definite work of dystopian propaganda , but doesn \\' t have the down ending of other works of this kind . the production design of this film is probably the best i \\' ve seen this year : it \\' s stunning , very pleasing to the eye , but still very cold . since genetics has ruled out any chance of improvement , the world has cooled into a state of inhumanity , and the sets echo a sense of shallow misery . and the sequence of all the high - level workers doing their jobs has a kind of gilliam - esque feel to it , showing the nightmare of slipping into a routine zombie - like life . the ability to perfect people has left humanity cold and generally unhappy . the acting from everyone is great , with thurman giving a wonderfully cold performance , and hawke creating a character who has been beaten down by the system but has found a new sense of optimism by a bitter man who was willing to give it out anyway ( interesting pointless fact : uma and ethan started dating after this film , and currently she is pregnant with his child ) . but the best performance belongs to jude law , who steals every scene he \\' s in , and creates a character filled with the pessimism over having such a horrible burden placed on his burden . i think that people are generally tempted by the fact that genetics can actually create perfection in a child , but whether or not they would actually act on this temptation is something i \\' m not sure of . \" gattaca \" warns us not to go any farther , chiefly because we \\' ll create a world of elitism where the elite are shallow and unhappy , and as bitter and angry as the lesser people are . and when i see a possible future featuring a 12 - fingered piano player , well folks , that just creeps me out .',\n",

after being hired by a russian mob lord as a bit of vengeance for the murder of his brother ( killed in the opening scenes ) , the jackal romps all over the northen hemisphere , from helsinki to virginia , setting up an elaborate scheme wherein he \\' ll be able to assasinate this person and still get away to live in seclusion . and like the saint , the jackal changes his look over and over and over again to elude people . the agent working on the case , cater preston ( sidney poitier - yes , that sidney poitier ) , working with a russian agent , valentina koslova ( diane venora - lady capulet from \" romeo + juliet \" ) , gives up early on and meets with an ex - ira man , declan mulqueen ( richard gere , putting up some tight competition between himself and brad pitt for worst fake irish accent of \\' 97 ) who \\' s in a massachusetts jail , but who has apparently seen the jackal , who has been eluding the law forever . soon , he \\' s out working with the two untrusting agents , and trying to help them catch him . there are numerous problems with the film , and which one is the biggest one is pretty impossible to put a finger on . the film is supposed to be a big suspense thriller , but save a couple moments , the film never achieves suspense , or even a sense of intrigue . sure , the big assasination attempt is a bit cool looking and even slightly tense , but every other scene in the film is too short and too dull to register . the film never picks up enough to become a thrilling experience , or even an entertaining one . it doesn \\' t help that the plot is designed to be complex , but falls into so many problems , like plot holes and unbelievable circumstances . the script of \" the jackal \" is a complete mess , mostly because it can \\' t decide what it wants to focus on . is this a film about a man trying to find redemption by catching a nasty killer ? is it a film about a nasty , amoral hitman who \\' s in everything for the money ? or is it a combination of both ? \" the jackal \" aims for the latter , but never focuses in on either character . the connection between the two feels completely edited , so much that in a scene when the jackal turns around and notices declan , you wonder how he recognized him so fast . the worst part is the little past they try to give declan , most notably his relationship with an old girlfriend , isabella ( mathilda may ) , given so little screen time that you almost forget her character exists until she pops up every now and then . the supporting characters are worse . sidney poitier is given a completely unplayable role , that of a man who is just stern sometimes , and other times more giving and likable . what is poitier doing here ? he \\' s one of the best living actors ! does he really need to waste his time doing drivel like this ? diane venora \\' s russian character is almost as bad , with a cigarette perpetually in her mouth , and a plastered on expressionless facade . it \\' s not that anyone \\' s bad here ; it \\' s that they have nothing to do . the plot is a joke , feeling like it was pasted together by someone in post - production who dropped each scene on the floor and pasted them together quickly so it could be released on time . the jackal himself is not even much of an international villain . there are several times where he \\' s in a tight situation and makes things worse for himself , the only explanation being that the filmmakers wanted to toss in a cheap thrill . take a scene where he \\' s being followed by some agents into a parking garage : he quickly sprays his car another color , and adds a solvent that if touched kills the person who touched it . doesn \\' t killing someone attract more attention than it does distract ? and does he think dying his hair bottle blond makes him fit in in a public place ? geez ! is there anything good here ? well . . . a couple things . i did like willis \\' s icy expressions ; he may not have been real suave or anything , but some of his looks are worth a chuckle . richard gere has a couple of good moments , making his character as likable as he possibly could have . and a couple sequences are kicky in that kind of proposterous , completely inane but fun kinda way , most notably : a sequence where he tests out a new gun on an annoying gun builder ( jack black ) ; and a bit where he seduces a gay washington man , which has its share of a couple good jokes , most particular a kiss by willis . but none of these elevate the film any higher than it could go ; they \\' re just little distractions along the way to amuse us mildly then toss us back into the world of dullness and stupidity that is \" the jackal . \" director michael caton - jones ( who directed the far superior \" rob roy \" ) has made a film that is made very couple months , one that is unentertaining , unintriguing , and pretty much cold , but will nevertheless make money because , hey , the trailers do make it look like it may be fun in that kind of retro - clancy kinda way . every now and then , the filmmakers get it right ( \" clear and present danger , \" which was enormous fun in that smart kinda way ) , but \" the jackal \" is an example of when they go completely wrong .',\n",

built clock , slowly building until finally exploding with a highly charged climax ( and an unpredictable one at that ) . and then you settle in for a nice resolution , which does not occur . it was at this point that i felt cheated . taking us on a terror ride of intrigue , we follow kevin lomax around , as he is the centerpiece of the film . everything occurs from his perspective . he is our representation on screen ( sort of ) . but we are forced to witness a conclusion which makes most of the film seem like a game . i don \\' t want to spoil the ending , so all i can say is go see the film and decide for yourself . perhaps the most shocking thing about the devil \\' s advocate is the extreme amount of everything . it earned its r rating for a reason . there is plenty of nudity , sex , violence , gore , and then you have gore , violence , sex , and more nudity . this film really isn \\' t subtle about anything , showing us everything . it actually surprises me that this film did not receive an nc - 17 rating , as it is quite harsh . however , the movie does have its merits , and nudity and sex are among those . i don \\' t condone sex and nudity in films , but if its there , i might as well enjoy it . the biggest merit of this film is also the most interesting to watch . the confrontations between kevin lomax and john milton are entertaining , but what stands out amidst this extreme hatred is the decline of the wife , mary ann . portrayed by the extremely effective charlize theron , mary ann \\' s problems are incredibly intense , and i found myself wanting to witness her decline . this may sound uncaring , but i wanted to watch because i felt sorry for her . she is the most interesting character on the screen , who is forced into a world where she is not wanted . something the devil \\' s advocate contained actually shocked me for reasons other than extreme violence and nudity , especially for a film of this nature . the story actually has something to say about humanity . in one of the last scenes , john milton explains to kevin lomax the game god plays with his children ( he is satan , of course ) . he comments that it is human nature to lust and loathe in vanity . then , god sets up rules which contradict human nature . this semi - religious bashing is more humorous than frightening . what milton says is so true about our society that i found myself laughing out loud , partially thinking it was funny , but patially realizing it was true . these moral dilemmas are present throughout the devil \\' s advocate , giving it an added depth many films skip over in their writing ( but i \\' m sure they came straight from the novel it was based on ) . when a film has something to say about our society , it deserves to be watched . the cast of the devil \\' s advocate is one of the highlights , as we see memorable faces , and they put spins on those memorable faces we don \\' t expect . heather matarazzo makes a brief appearance as the terrorized victim in the opening court case , and she does a great job . probably the big surprise of this film is keanu reeves . he has proven himself an uneven actor ( successes such as speed and bombs such as johnny mnemonic ) , but he tops himself with this performance . i have never seen him more believable to date . al pacino is of course the scene stealer . his devilish performance is equal to those of jack nicholson ( the witches of eastwick ) and max von sydow ( needful things ) . he could have easily gone too far over the top in many scenes , but he remains completely believable ( if that is the correct term ) . jeffrey jones ( mostly known as the principal in ferris bueller \\' s day off ) also gives a good performance as eddie barzoon . judith ivey manages a credible performance as the mother who holds a secret to kevin \\' s past . connie nielson is very effective in her role , and she also appears naked several times . one familiar face with a twist was \" coach \" star , craig t . nelson , who gives a very good performance . the devil \\' s advocate is rated r for sexuality , nudity , violence , language , and some gore . at 144 minutes , this film moves along fairly quickly . for the first two hours , i sat completely engaged in the good performances and strong characters . the technical quality is also remarkable , with great special effects and a good musical score . director taylor hackford has managed to create a very disturbing motion picture , only to ruin a good chunk of tension with the final fifteen minutes . i guess my biggest problem with the ending is the fact that i went into the theater expecting a disturbing film , and hackford gave me just that for a long time . but just before the end , he got jitterish and relied on the hollywood safety net in order to make his film more mainstream . personally , i would have preferred it ending fifteen minutes early .',\n",

              " (\"once again , the battle is dreamworks versus disney : earlier this year , the mammoth companies fought to the death with their end - of - the - world asteroid flicks , deep impact and armageddon . here we are now , just a few months later , and they ' re at it again with dueling bug movies , antz and a bug ' s life . what i find so astonishing is that both pairs of movies are so inherently similar in both story and execution . i mean , come on -- what were the chances of two studios both deciding to bring out computer - animated films about bugs ? as was the case with the meteor movies , disney has come out on top : though antz is a likable movie , a bug ' s life is far superior . in fact , this movie made me realize what was wrong with antz : i became immersed in the world of a bug ' s life , while antz just made me scrutinize everything . but it ' s not really fair to base an entire review on a comparison . a bug ' s life is a remarkable film in its own right , and deserves to be seen apart from any other computer - animated film about bugs . in fact , it ' s one of the best films this year : it ' s smart , subtle , and funny , but it ' s also perfect family entertainment and relentlessly entertaining . i haven ' t had such a good time at the movies in months . it tells the story of an ant named flick ( voice by dave foley ) ; he ' s a nice guy , but he ' s also a troublemaker . the ants spend all season putting together the offering , a big pile of food that they provide for the grasshoppers . just before the grasshoppers come , flick accidentally knocks over the offering , and ruins everything for the entire colony : the grasshopper ' s leader , hopper ( kevin spacey ) , is enraged , and tells them that the ants need twice the food by the end of summer , or they ' re all dead . flick , feeling responsible for this , sets off to look for help -- he realizes that the only way to be rid of the grasshoppers is to fight them . he heads to the city ( the city being a house a few miles away ) , where he finds a colorful bunch of circus bugs : a ladybug ( denis leary , who is spectacular ) , a black widow ( bonnie hunt ) , a caterpillar ( joe ranft ) , a butterfly ( madeline kahn ) , a rhinoceros beetle ( michael mcshane ) , and a stick ( david hyde - pierce , also giving a hilarious performance ) . flick doesn ' t know they ' re actors , and they don ' t know that flick needs them to kill a bunch of grasshoppers , so they return to the colony with flick and find themselves in an unusual position . the most obvious element of a bug ' s life is the quality of animation . created by pixar , the same people who brought us toy story , a bug ' s life has some of the most amazing visuals i ' ve ever seen . the bugs seem to inhabit a three - dimensional space , and occasionally there will be a shot that is indistinguishable from live action . this is a lush , colorful world , full of life and imagination : the way the animators insert the things all of us see in our daily lives ( matches , bottlecaps , tin cans , etc . ) and make them active objects in the bugs ' world is innovative . the film is also mercilessly exciting , particularly in a superbly - staged scene involving our heroes ' escape from a bird ( a little bird never seemed so huge and threatening ) . but the makers of a bug ' s life know where the importance lies : story and characters . flick , with solid voice work from foley , is a great guy to lead the story . but the real treat comes with the circus bugs ; they ' re such a likable group of characters -- the standouts are the stick ( hyde - pierce is so good ) , francis the ladybug , and the big fat caterpillar . all of these bugs have more than a token personality , which makes the suspenseful scenes work because we care about the bugs , and it also keeps the tear - jerking scenes from seeming obligatory . in my review of antz , i said that the film is a clever cop - out because it presents a bunch of little humans reacting to an ant - like existence . in concept , a bug ' s life is basically the same movie , except that i was never given enough time to find things that i didn ' t like about it . with such strong work in both animation and script , a bug ' s life is nothing but a joy to sit through . it really is too bad that it had to come out so close to that other bug movie , but a bug ' s life is so good that i ' m sure it will find its audience . after a slew of endlessly violent and cynical movies , it ' s downright refreshing to sit through an innocent picture like this and laugh without feeling guilty .\",\n",

a tough cop who beats the hell out of a guy who tried to kill him ? doesn \\' t sound too unreasonable to me , considering the genre . but let \\' s face it , any time van damme tries to be dramatic , he looks silly . so maximum risk is a little different from most other action films . while watching it , i was surprised , and a little disappointed , in the relative lack of pyrotechnics . but watching some of these other action films is sort of like experiencing a sugar rush ; after the initial excitement , there \\' s not much left . although it \\' s short on spectacle , lam \\' s film leaves a better and more lasting impression , i think . i \\' m more impressed by it now than i was while watching it , and to me , that \\' s a good sign . go see maximum risk , but don \\' t expect a typical hollywood action movie ; expect a sort of funky hong kong - hollywood action movie . the flying inkpot rating system : * wait for the tv2 broadcast . * * a little creaky , but still better than staying at home with gotcha ! * * * pretty good , bring a friend . * * * * amazing , potent stuff . * * * * * perfection . see it twice . dr t . white teaches film at the english language and literature department of the national university of singapore , but we don \\' t hold this against him .',\n",

              " ('i must admit that i was a tad skeptical of \" good will hunting \" , based both on the previews and the first fifteen minutes of the film , in which the main character will hunting ( matt damon ) , an mit janitor in his early twenties , is discovered to be an einstein - level closet genius when he solves two extraordinarily difficult math problems overnight . the only problem is that will is a tough street kid who \\' s had his share of run - ins with the law , and before long he \\' s being hauled in for assault after a parking lot fight . professor lambeau ( stellan skarsgard ) , who had brought up the math problems in his lectures , tracks him down and strikes a deal with the police : will is to be released , provided he works with lambeau on his math research regularly and attends therapy sessions . this sounds like the formula for mildly charming fluff , but \" good will hunting \" rises above its fairly mundane premise to deliver a poignant and clever drama . a conflict gradually emerges between lambeau and will \\' s therapist sean mcguire ( robin williams ) - lambeau wants to get will to use his brain , while sean wants him to listen to his heart , both of which he has been largely neglecting . will finds that the former is much easier than the latter , so much so , in fact , that he gets bored with it and grows increasingly resistant to lambeau \\' s attempts to recruit him into the academic lifestyle . he also has his share of problems with his girlfriend skylar ( minnie driver ) , an mit student who is moving to california at the end of the school year and would like a reluctant will to come with her . what makes \" good will hunting \" work so well , aside from the strong performances ( especially from damon and williams ) , is the depth of characterization and the representation of the conflicts in will \\' s life . the script \\' s sympathies seem to lie more with sean mcguire than with lambeau , but neither of them is presented as completely right or wrong . lambeau , while he may seem a little cold at times , is still written well enough that we like him as a character even when we \\' re not sure if we like what he has to say . and sean , for all his warm - heartedness , has , as lambeau and later will point out , not lived up to his full intellectual potential either ; the therapy sessions turn out to be just as revelatory for sean as they do for will . will \\' s reaction to this situation , and the way in which he slowly becomes more receptive to skylar and to sean , is presented in a believable fashion and in a way that forces the audience to consider all the characters \\' opinions , rather than setting up an obvious \" right \" and \" wrong \" side and beating them over the head with it . for a film with such an extraordinary character , \" good will hunting \" presents itself as remarkably ordinary ; it achieves the difficult task of making the next albert einstein into an everyman , a character to whom the audience can easily relate and who must make choices similar to those that almost everyone faces at one time or another . this film gives us real drama when it so easily could have given us merely melodrama , by having the government kidnap will to use him in covert spy missions or introducing some other equally far - fetched situation . \" good will hunting \" also has its share of fun humor , such as when will , in an early therapy session , pretends to be hypnotized and smoothly parodies the alien abduction scenarios that have become so well known in popular culture . and in the one scene in which government agents do in fact appear , will blows them off with a hilariously scathing accusation of human rights violations in africa . will \\' s relationship with his friends , most notably chucky ( ben affleck ) , is usually rather amusing , if somewhat crude ( the film has 100 + uses of the \\' f \\' word , which was most likely the reason for its r - rating ) , and lends itself well to the development of will \\' s character . add all this to the fact that \" good will hunting \" even manages to pull off an uplifting happy ending without getting excessively sentimental , and you might be wondering why i haven \\' t given this film four stars . well , for one thing , no matter how well damon and affleck , who wrote the screenplay , and director gus van sant pull it off , the story is still rather contrived and not particularly original . there are also a few scenes that did feel a bit formulaic , including one that was supposed to be emotional but really just seemed like the obligatory crying scene for any movie involving therapy sessions . still , \" good will hunting \" takes its premise a lot farther than i thought it would , and is definitely one of the better personal dramas i have seen in the last few years , and as of right now it stands as one of the top five on my list of \\' 97 films .',\n",

( note to the filmmaker : why did the character of lance make asides to the camera followed by silence that i \\' m assuming was inserted for the purpose of waiting until the laughter of the audience had subsided ? ) april \\' s parents , feeling like there is no recourse , call in a favor to president clinton and send a nuclear bomb ( whose circuitry inexplicably is made up of a homosexual performer ) their way . the bomb is a dud thanks to the work of the \" circuitry \" and they re - wire it and send it back to washington d . c . , destroying it . mr . and ms . pfferpot give up trying to get their daughter back and instead decide to join her as they have some alternative sexual practices of their own . i \\' m not sure if writer / director / co - star jeff b . harmon was purposely trying to offend people because he believes in some of the ideas his movie presents or if he was just going for cheap laughs . either way , he manages to present some of the most offensive material i have ever seen in a movie . the film opens with a preacher running a small african - american child out of town , and then later moves on to the hanging of a michael jackson impersonator by the ku klux klan ( during a jaunty musical number ) , preceded by remarks about \" gays and straights finally being able to put their differences behind them and work together to hate others , such as the jews \" . if harmon was merely trying to point out how idiotic society can be , then i apologize for being so harsh on elements of his film , but it is presented so mean spiritedly that i can \\' t help but feel like he had some serious intent . as for the entire central theme of the movie , i \\' m afraid that it \\' s one that i just don \\' t get . i tried to keep an open mind while watching it , but the homosexual elements were just too prevalent for my tastes . it was hard enough to watch them bash other races and sexes without them preaching about the virtues of being homosexual and accepted by society . how does one expect to be accepted if they are just as guilty of non - acceptance ? i \\' m not prone to judging anyone and i believe that people should be free to explore whatever avenues they wish free from the scornful eye of society , but don \\' t force your particular rhetoric down my throat if you aren \\' t going to show the same respect for my preferences that you wish from me . again , maybe i \\' m missing the satirical point that harmon is trying to make , but if so , i think it could have been handled a little more tactfully . as far as musical comedies go , isle of lesbos is no trey parker and matt stone musical , but a good portion of the songs are maddeningly catchy . despite the disturbing visuals , \" mom and apple pie \" stuck with me for the rest of the day . speaking of disturbing visuals , \" wedding bells ain \\' t ringing \" could have been a decent song , but the accompanying visuals of spousal abuse are more harrowing than this film should be displaying . \" i \\' m a lesbian \" ( which is touted in the press release as being particularly popular ) is also pretty good , but a good portion of that could be due to the stellar singing voice of ms . smith . it \\' s mainly on her excellent vocals that my rating of this film is based . the other performers are decent , save for the rosie o \\' donnell like performance given by danica sheridan . i have no inherent problem with her character ; it is just her singing voice that leaves little to be desired . one particular musical number , \" lesbian rock \" , was one of the lowest points i have ever experienced in my film - going life thanks to a strained and lackluster vocal job by sheridan . the film ends about twenty minutes before the credits actually roll . the remainder of the running time is padded out with a few more songs ( \" lesbian rock \" included ) and the ridiculously presented anti - nukes message tacked on to the end for no reason other than to make it a feature length film . once the \" isle of lesbos reprise \" was reached , i felt the story had already been wrapped up well enough to end it all . why was the film needlessly stretched out past its obvious end ? isle of lesbos is available on videocassette from www . indie - underground . com . the transfer is pretty clean ( and all the detail of the wrinkled cloth and paint backdrops are readily apparent ) and the film is letterboxed at approximately 1 . 85 : 1 . in many respects , isle of lesbos has incredible cult potential ( like a rocky horror for the new millennium ) . this film is by no means my cup of tea , but i know there are those out there who will enjoy it . if you think it might be for you , then by all means seek it out . i , on the other hand , will be cleansing my palette with a good action film like gladiator . . . wait . aren \\' t gladiator films considered to be . . . oh , never mind .',\n",

              " (\"among multitude of erotic thrillers , that had been released in the early 1990s , woman of desire is interesting only because it was directed by robert ginty , star of the b - grade action films of the previous decade . those who tend not to be nostalgic about 1980s can find very good reason in the type of movies that made ginty the star . as director , ginty did very little to improve that impression . the protagonist of the movie is jack ( played by jeff fahey ) , yacht skipper that falls madly in love with christina ford ( played by bo derek ) . however , she has relationship with rich and powerful jonathan ashby ( steven bauer ) . one stormy night , the tragedy occurs and jack is accused of rape and murder . however , his good friend walter j . hill ( robert mitchum ) happens to be very good lawyer , so jack might even prove his innocence in the end . belonging more to the genre of courtroom drama than erotic thriller , woman of desire distinguishes itself from similar films by having almost all characters behaving like total idiots . unfortunately , this film isn ' t comedy and any laugh is unintentional . the characters are totally antipathetic and irritating and soon we stop caring what would happen to them . the actors that play them don ' t help either . that is especially the case with jeff fahey , whose jack is so stupid that even the character played by fahey in lawnmower man looks like a genius in comparison . his partner bo derek , on the other hand , shows that she didn ' t age enough to cease being the sex goddess , but that is small compensation for her apparent lack of acting talents . ginty , on the other hand , tries to bring some life in the movie by using many flashbacks and strange angles of shooting , but in the end it gets only irritating to the already bored and dissatisfied viewer .\",\n",

              " ('jacques tati \\' s 1953 classic \" les vacances de m . hulot \" ( also known as \" mr . hulot \\' s vacation , \" in english ) ought to be the textbook on how to do non ? dialogue comedy in film . the characters hardly ever speak to each other directly , and the film operates on the paper ? thin premise that monsieur hulot , played by tati himself , is awkward and clumsy and generally manages to annoy the other guests at the beach resort hotel where he is taking a week \\' s vacation . yet the film had me beside myself laughing more consistently than any in recent memory . part of the reason the film works so well is the clever setup for the various gags . slapstick has often been regarded as an unsophisticated and even crude form of comedy , but i think part of the reason for this is that it often seems forced : you can only see movie characters start running after something and then crash face - first into a pole so many times before you start to wonder what all these poles are doing there in the first place or why these people don \\' t watch where they \\' re going . in \" les vacances de m . hulot , \" the gags build upon each other and often start out relatively low - key . in one sequence , for example , hulot is painting the side of his small row boat on the beach when , while his back is turned , the paint can gets caught up in the oncoming waves , washes away , then comes back up on the other side of the boat . while crossing over to get the can , hulot steps in the boat and unknowingly cracks it . when he actually takes the boat out into the water , it breaks in half , but the two halves flip up against each other , trapping him inside as the bystanders mistake it for a shark fin and panic on the beach ensues . tati doesn \\' t waste a single opportunity for humor ; scenes that might have yielded one joke in most comedies are good for at least four or five in this film . it has been said that comedy relies on frustrating the audience \\' s expectations , and \" les vacances de m . hulot \" succeeds brilliantly in that area as well . tati accomplishes this largely through a sort of deadpan understatement . when hulot goes into a separate room during dinner and starts playing a record at defeaningly loud volume , no fights or shouting matches ensue ; instead , the waiter calmly walks in and shuts off the power in the room , disconnecting the record player and leaving a puzzled hulot sitting in the dark . tati also uses running gags to this effect , allowing them to keep running far longer than most comedy directors would ; more often than not , we can see them coming and think , \" oh , he \\' s not going to do that again , \" but , lo and behold , he does . for example , there is a recurring joke in which hulot \\' s noisy , sputtering car engine wakes everyone in the middle of the night as an exterior shot reveals the hotel \\' s lights coming on one by one . then this image turns up again in the finale , which i will not give away other than to say that involves a lot more noise in the middle of the night than a car engine could ever produce . the ending is one of two elements that really make this a four - star film as opposed to merely an above - average , clever comedy . as much as i was laughing during this film , i was thinking to myself occasionally that tati had to top himself at the end to really make this work as a complete viewing experience ; suffice it to say that he did . the other important aspect is that the film never seems disdainful of its characters . it easily could have turned the tables on hulot and had the other guests exact some kind of revenge on him ; alternatively , it could have portrayed the others as humorless curmudgeons . instead , tati seems to regard his characters with cheerful amusement more than anything else and invites the audience to like them , however strange or irritating they might seem . \" les vacances de m . hulot \" is not subtitled , but the dialogue is sparse and for the most part not terribly essential to the flow of events . anyone with a taste for this kind of absurd humor ought to make this film their next rental from the video store . note : \" les vacances de m . hulot \" was not rated by the mpaa . it would at most receive a pg rating .',\n",

              " ('teenagers have a lot of power in hollywood . every year countless films will be made targeting that audience in particular , and rely on the entire teenage population to turn out on friday and saturday nights , wallets in hand . the formula is very simple , you make a film with a big name young actor or actress with sex appeal . you add a high school environment that features everyone from prom queens to math club nerds , and then a very simple relationship conflict that can be worked out in 90 minutes , the typical teenage attention span . the response is enormous as this part of the population will waste it92s money on almost any = film set in an environment they can relate to , and , most importantly , they don92t care to judge films = 92 quality , so any piece of trash will = due . that is just what never been kissed , the latest film from director raja gosnell , is ; trash . josie geller ( drew barrymore ) is the youngest copy editor in the history of the chicago sun times . she has her own personal assistant , unlimited supplies , and her own office . but she is very much dismayed with her position in life . there is nothing she wants more than to be a reporter and go out into the field , where she can play a more active role in the chicago media . so when an assignment is quite literally thrown at her out of nowhere , she jumps at it with elation . constantly smothering josie in the work place is her friend anita ( molly shannon ) and her amicable superior , gus ( john c . reilly ) . the two of them are both stricken with horror upon hearing the news of her first assignment , as they both deem her to be an office worker and not a reporter . however , since this film is aimed at a teenage audience with little patience for character conflict , this otherwise interesting scenario is resolved within two minutes , and josie is headed for the field . obviously , the field assignment involves a high school . specifically , she is to become an undercover reporter at a high school , by enrolling in the senior class and \" becoming one of them . \" i don92t think that i = need to even begin to explain all the impossibilities of this situation ever occurring , so i won92t . the movie develops into josie trying to find the life that she never led in high school . interwoven flashback scenes show us just how much of a dork she truly was , and she appears to be heading down that road again . fortunately for this lame production , other characters do appear that make some of these high school scenes both humorous and remotely interesting . they include the predictable love stories , between both a student ( jeremy jordan ) and a teacher ( michael vartan ) , to show that josie is really two people in one body . also , her younger brother and opposite , rob ( david arquette ) comes into her new found life and even causes a rare scene that is mildly provocative . the humor found in this film is actually quite amusing . typical for teenage films , it is chalk full of sexual innuendoes and condom humor . one scene in particular features a certain classroom activity involving bananas and latex that is absolutely hysterical . most of the other jokes are straight forward high school humor that anyone who has ever been to high school can appreciate and will enjoy . but those still don92t = recover for the total lack of quality in this movie . following this trend of high school movie rules , comes the general acting . it is even worse than the trend of overplaying a scenario from film to film . in this case , drew barrymore is absolutely painful to watch . she is required to play her character on two levels , having some very black and white transitions . and although some scenes are written to be particular shades of gray , she seems to hold that color throughout all of her screen time . at one point she is alone with an obvious love interest on a ferris wheel , and is expected to him on an adult level , since he is one , her teacher . but she never seems to get out of the gray area , and in doing so she makes a mockery out of his otherwise good performance . following barrymore is the pitiful molly shannon ( saturday night live ) . she seems to be limited to playing an ecstatic character that no one can relate to , and draws the attention of an audience as simply unrealistic . it is these \" qualities \" that prevent the aforementioned condom scene from being one of the few decent . luckily there is one great performance to emerge out of this otherwise bleak film . david arquette ( scream ) takes home the prize for being able to stand out in an ensemble performance that is absolutely pathetic , and not have his brilliant acting ruined . and as a central character he gets to take on his own mini - plot , which is one of the few well done parts of never been kissed . in a dazzling cherry - on - the - sundae type piece of work , he does an absolutely hilarious tom cruise impression from the 1983 hit , risky business . never been kissed is a mediocre film at best . the predictable plot has become so overplayed in hollywood , that it is sickening to watch time and again , and this film is no exception . the acting is just as bad , but there is the one positive presence of david arquette to add some light . unfortunately , the bottom line is that the movie will be a success , because teenagers will pay to see any trash .',\n",

              " ('this is a film about secrets , some that are innocent like those of a cute little farm girl , frances boyd ( ashley ) . others that are between a married couple that is impacting their relationship , like the problems of infertility affecting this upwardly mobile couple , geoffrey gaines ( stephen ramsey ) , the medical researcher working for a big corporation called fex and striving to get a patent for his experiment and become recognized in his field , and his artist wife , lillian ( miriam healy - louie ) , who reluctantly stands behind her husband suppressing her natural artistic tendencies in order to make the marriage work . and , still other secrets that have a greater implication for the world and are deadly in a political sense , of science carried out by the big corporations like it was a business run for the bottom line . receiving a summer grant to study \" chemo - electric therapy , \" geoffrey and his wife are hoping that a summer spent away from the intensity of the big city will bring back the romance that is dwindling from their marriage and that the casualness of the country atmosphere will give them more time together , as their three - year marriage has become shaky because he is more interested in his work than he is in her . he has slyly managed to keep his work as secretive as possible by locking himself in the lab , which is off limits to her , as he secretly goes about conducting experiments on rats and mice , convincing her that what he is doing is to benefit humanity with possible new treatments and cures to illnesses . his main argument is , that this is what the public wants , they don \\' t want to hear about how some animals had to die because of these experiments , they just want the benefits of science . that he is depicted as a monster creating another monster , much like frankenstein was created , is the argument skewed by the director against his bad science ( science as a business ) as opposed to the good science ( science that cares about the small farmer ) , which is represented by the handsome and almost perfect gentleman , alex vine ( david ) , a young ecologist who chooses to work in the field , trying to get the farmers to go back to organic farming . he is hired by the university to monitor the dangers of pesticides and all the chemicals the farmer is almost forced to use to survive financially , as it is doing irreparable harm to him and the consumer because of all the health risks attached to this new way of farming , methods that have just come about in the last thirty - years and are being pushed by the big companies to enhance their profit margins . the third view in all this is the artist \\' s , represented by lillian , who points out that the artist \\' s work is shown in public and scrutinized constantly , \" why shouldn \\' t the same be true of the scientist ? \" she argues that the artist is the watchdog for the public , questioning what is good or evil in society , something that bad science has completely ignored . geoffrey , impatient to get ahead with his research , feels bogged down by the bureaucrats in his firm who fail to provide him with the three chimps he needs to experiment on , as he contacts one of the company \\' s higher ups to argue his case , but decides he can \\' t wait any longer for their help , so he sets an animal trap in the countryside and catches chester , the gorgeous pet dog of frances , a dog that means so much to her and her family because he saved her life . while out in the field with the bloodied trapped dog already in the back seat of his car , he is spotted by alex and one of his co - workers , and nervously invites them to dinner with his wife , afraid that alex will spot what he is doing , as he rushes away from the area . in the dinner scene that was , unfortunately , flatly done , but was nevertheless the heart of the film , as all the main characters get a chance to speak out from the point of view they represent as they eat meat , a means of getting protein that the radical scientists have eschewed since they became so politically correct about everything . the scientists engage in a rational argument , highlighting their different points of view , while lillian reacts in an emotional way , siding mostly with david \\' s view but coming at it from a much different angle . it was as if the actors were puppets on strings that the director controlled and they just spewed out their generalized philosophies . that the director \\' s point of view is absolutely right , is beside the point . the point is that the characters lost their humanity and became one - dimensional characters . geoffrey was likened to a hideous monster , alex vine was likened to his last name , the one who holds fast to the ground ensuring that the plant has stability , while lillian was likened to the muse of poetry and art , the inspiration for goodness and beauty . alex has been spending a lot of time together with lillian , as these two seem to share the same views and are physically attracted to each other , but when the time is ripe for an affair to take place between them , lillian changes her mind and decides not to go up to alex \\' s apartment . geoffrey is already suspicious of alex and considers him an enemy , and the marriage seems to be coming apart and all his cunning tricks to possess her are no longer working , as it is now impossible to see any good in him and there becomes no reason why she would remain with him . the relationship has disintegrated way beyond the point of her just feeling lonely . the dog is discovered by alex and her in a deplorable state after geoffrey is seen by them electrically shocking it , and mercifully the dog dies . the only thing left for her to do is walk out of the marriage , but she also fails to respond to david \\' s loving gesture for her to stay with him , instead opting to head back to the city . the farmer whose dog was tortured to death comes into the scientist \\' s lab and knocks him cold while he was in the middle of a phone conversation with one of the higher - ups who told him all the animals he needs are on the way . what is progress ? what can one expect out of life ? is the small farmer about to become extinct ? the answers to these questions can best be answered by either good science or art , which are both closely related to the american natives vision of a world entrusted to mankind so that he can respect it and take care of it and enrich it with his creations to benefit mankind in a peaceful way . that this work fails to be subtle and polarizes opinions , leaving no room for deeper arguments , is the shame of this decent and smart film , that tried so hard to say what it felt it had to say but said it so loudly without trusting its audience to catch on to its message by not making everything seem so black and white . no telling said a lot about the harmful trends it sees science going in ; it probably said too much and would have been better off if its vision was more poetical and less didactic . there is something about listening to a lecture that turns off the rebel in me , as i don \\' t like being hit in the head with the truth but prefer to have it presented in the form that leads to inspiration or told metaphorically . that is not to say that i found the film without considerable merit , that inspite of its shortcomings , it was worth seeing because of its visual statements , though they were also not too subtle , they were at least effective in setting up the intense mood that the film needed to show that there is a mental war going on currently , of those who believe one way is right and others who differ with them , and that anyone who is neutral must be considered an enemy because of their indifference . the stakes in this ecological struggle are that high . perhaps the most powerful visual statement in the film , was the dead cow from pesticides shown in the opening scene . it was the image that lillian spent her time painting all summer and had the same affect for her as did the animal faces in picasso \\' s guernica had for him . both artists envisioned the horrors that man could do against the world , and represented this unspoken pain on the faces of the animals so that anyone who cares to really see what is going on , will not mistake which side of the fence he or she should be on . the pain that lillian feels , as she forgets about her desires to raise a family , and she stares at her painting of the cow and the song , \" make the world go away \" blares out from the background , after she has learned that frances \\' beautiful and loving dog has been brutalized by her monster of a husband , all in the name of science , had a raw power to it that personalizes the dangers of bad science . perhaps , the most pertinent question the film asks , requires an answer that must be resolved by the farmers and the consumers who are most caught in the changing world and its new way of doing business , as the question becomes , can science be happily married with art ?',\n",

              " ('ingredients : starving artist lusting after a beautiful woman from his childhood synopsis : great expectations ( 1998 ) is a modernized version of a charles dickens novel . in the original charles dickens classic an orphan boy named pip learns about life through his friendship with an escaped convict , his relationship with a bitter old lady named miss havisham , and his hopeless lifetime infatuation with havisham \\' s snobbish adopted daughter , estella . the gist of the story is that an anonymous benefactor sends pip to london for pip to become an upper class \" gentleman . \" pip leaves for london with \" great expectations \" to be groomed into a gentleman so that he can one day be classy enough to marry estella . but life has a way of complicating things . pip becomes an arrogant s . o . b . until he learns just who his secret benefactor is . in this new 1998 version of great expectations a poor florida lad named finn ( ethan hawke ) with a talent for drawing has an early memory of helping an escaped convict ( robert de niro ) . but soon the focus of finn \\' s life becomes romance , as he develops a lifelong infatuation with estella ( gwyneth paltrow ) , an upper crust girl with some psychological and emotional issues due to being raised in a dysfunctional environment . estella was raised in wealth by ms . dinsmoor ( anne bancroft ) , an eccentric , aged and embittered , man - hating single aunt whose groom left her abandoned at the altar on the day of her marriage . this causes estella to \\' fear the daylight \\' of relationships , but finn thinks it \\' s just a case of snobbery . when finn becomes a young man , an anonymous benefactor sets finn up in new york with the connections and publicity to be groomed into a famous artist . finn leaves florida with \" great expectations \" to be a successful artist so that some day he might become classy enough to marry the snobbish estella . what will happen to all of finn \\' s \" great expectations ? \" opinion : if you \\' re looking for a romance with a happy ending , look no further ; you \\' ve found one here . ethan hawke is romantic lead . ( he romanced winona ryder in reality bites . he romanced julie delpy in before sunrise . he romanced uma thurman in gattaca . now in great expectations he gets to chase gwyneth paltrow , a rail - thin blonde . ) hawke plays a lovestruck , earnest and unchanged finn throughout the film . meanwhile paltrow portrays estella as alternating between infuriating tease and ice princess ; estella \\' s whole purpose is to get men to fall in love and then hurt them rather than become intimate . anne bancroft goes a little overboard as the deranged and pessimistic ms . dinsmoor , while robert de niro carries off the convict part suitably . the difference between the classic dickens novel and this 1998 adaptation is that the dickens novel is ripe with deep and timeless themes about class struggle and love , whereas great expectations ( 1998 ) is more artsy , less complicated story about a 1990s artist dealing with a lifetime tease .',\n",

) far too annoying far too often . like in 1998s \" bulworth \" , when the movie was over i didn \\' t care one little iota about the main character . at least warren beatty tried to make a statement with his dreary and overrated film , though . \" showgirls \" is too stupid to make a statement . some people claim that the story is based on the legendary \" all about eve \" of all things ! if exploitation expert joe eszterhas was half the screenwriter that joseph l . mankiewicz was , he \\' d be . . . well , he \\' d be a good screenwriter . instead , this project may have sunk his career . he wrote the ( ha ha ! ) script and the usually reliable paul verhoeven directed . the same team who created a good sex - film in 1992 ( \" basic instinct \" ) struck out here with their occasional violence , gratuitous x - rated sex scenes , and numerous ( and quite unnecessary ) lesbian overtones . the predictable storyline revolves around nomi streaking into las vegas to make it big as a dancer . after the supposed street - smart young \" lady \" gets conned out of her suitcase by a slack - jawed yokel in the opening sequence , she befriends a tailor of the glamorous stage production at the \" stardust hotel \" . nomi doesn \\' t take advantage of this contact to break into the big - time of dirty dancing right away . first , she becomes a lap dancer at a scummy strip club . she sells her hot little wares at \" the cheetah \" for a short time , turning on the fictitious customers and the actual theatre audience . hey , i never said she wasn \\' t a hot number . . . maybe it \\' s that , her body , which gets her into the big - time when the star of the \" stardust hotel \" , crystal connors ( gina gershon ) stops into the strip club ( it certainly isn \\' t her brains or pleasant disposition ! ) . crystal requests a private lap dance for her boyfriend ( kyle maclachlan ) . he also happens to be the pleasure - seeking worm who runs the big show . crystal gets nomi onto the \" stardust \" team and , after an interminable amount of time , nomi \" earns \" the role of crystal \\' s understudy . the slut then deliberately injures and hospitalizes crystal . it was almost laughable that nomi had the guts to claim that she \\' s \" not a whore \" . that \\' s a phrase we hear a few different times and it \\' s completely ludicrous . of course she is ! she sells her soul to make it big , but in the end we \\' re supposed to believe that she \\' s a better person than that . we \\' re supposed to root for her . no way ! she \\' s a tramp and a back - stabber who deserved nothing -- least of all vindication in the . . . ahem . . . climax . she is not a good person and they take over two hours to explain that the audience should think that she is . the sub - plot with a male dancer ( glenn plummer ) who claims to see talent in nomi is just a gratuitous opportunity to let her dance naked a little bit more . it sure ain \\' t character development ! plummer also appeared in \" speed \" in \\' 94 in a smaller , yet better role . this sub - plot goes absolutely nowhere except maybe to deliver an unsubtle hint that fornicators should practice birth control . kyle maclachlan must have been promised a big pay - day or his standards have dipped since appearing in \" blue velvet \" . that picture was weird , but some critics claim it \\' s one of the best movies of the \\' 80s . now ol \\' kyle can say that he acted in one of the worst of the \\' 90s , too . his sleazy character is important to \" showgirls \" , but we don \\' t learn anything about him . he uses people to get what he wants , but that only means that he fits in well with the other characters in this movie . is he a villain ? who cares ! ultimately , this movie is as tiresome as it is explicit . everyone must know by now about the soft - core acts of copulation , especially the riotous romp between berkley and maclachlan in his pool . what few reviewers take issue with is how mean - spirited this movie is . everyone \\' s either having sex , exacting revenge , or wishing they were having sex or exacting revenge . it \\' s just too hard to take ( especially for over two hours ) . if we must be exposed to the evils of the vegas world , why couldn \\' t verhoeven have also made a point of highlighting the whispers , grunts , and other sounds during the dance numbers ?

              " (\"one of the biggest cliches of any serial killer film is also one of the most believable . you know , the one where the detective looks at a wall of pictures and other police information , and suddenly spots the clue which reveals who the killer is . sure , it ' s been used over and over , but for some reason , it is always fun to watch . this cliche pretty much describes the level kiss the girls works on : overused , but always fun . one of my personal rules about watching a film is not how original the film is , but how it goes around giving its story . this rule applies highly to kiss the girls . there is something psychologically stimulating in a well - crafted serial killer movie , and kiss the girls is certainly well made . however , the whole film screams of unoriginality , and so it relies on the power of its actors and the technical detail to pull it through . well , not only are the actors capable of pulling it through , but they add so much to the film that nearly every flaw is covered up . unfortunately , one of the most revealing and rather insulting choices by the filmmakers ( one that seven , a film a lot like this one , knew not to make ) was to put the name of the killer in the opening credits . that may give the actor credit for the role , but throughout the film , hidden in my mind , i was waiting for him to appear on screen , which spoiled the mystery . however , credit must be given to the director for suspending this knowledge through most of the film . plotwise , kiss the girls shows almost no originality . we are introduced to detective alex cross ( morgan freeman ) , a forensic psychologist , and immediately we are given the cliched scene establishing him as the hero . he gets a call about a woman who has shot her husband and is now threatening to kill herself . obviously cross succeeds at getting the gun , but this scene is quickly forgotten during the next scene . at his house , cross is told that his neice , naomi ( gina ravera ) , has been missing for four days . this provides the motivation for cross to find the killer , but we are never given a chance to establish the relationship between the two , and as a result , we can ' t sympathize with detective cross . however , what makes kiss the girls slightly original is the introduction of one of the abductees . . . before she is abducted . dr . kate mctiernan ( ashley judd , the actress of the judd family ) is a smart , athletic woman , and because of these traits , becomes a target for casanova -- what the serial killer likes to call himself . because of these character - developing scenes , we care for mctiernan , making the abduction scene all that more suspenseful . after being abducted , mctiernan wakes up and finds herself in a cell somewhere in the woods . remembering that the killer gave her certain rules , she decides to break one of them by calling out . when casanova comes to punish her , she breaks out and escapes by jumping over a waterfall . after she is found , she begins to help cross find his neice . from this moment on , kiss the girls takes on the form of every other serial killer film , as the two leads search for the rest of the victims held captive . many people will compare this film to 1995 ' s seven , another killer film starring morgan freeman , but i presume that the similarities are intentional . the screenplay , by david klass , is adapted from the novel written by james patterson , and yet i don ' t quite see how this story could have worked in novel form . what makes kiss the girls so good is the acting and the technical and visual impressiveness . the cinematography , by aaron schneider , is reminiscient of seven , and sometimes i felt that many of the shots were trying too hard to impress us . sometimes a simple shot is the best one . however , many of the shots are stunning , and unlike seven , most of them take place during the day , in sunlight . the scene when ashley judd is running through the forest is extremely well done , in more than one way . the camera work is terrific , but the editing makes this scene work so well . the chaotic and mtv - type cutting gives the audience a sense of confusion and unawareness , exactly what judd ' s character is experiencing . however , the best aspect of kiss the girls is its actors . morgan freeman is one of today ' s most powerful and believable actors . detective cross is a very good character for him , although it is just a similar one to the character in seven . because of freeman ' s powerful presence , he carries half the film by himself . the other half is carried by ashley judd , one of today ' s most promising dramatic actresses . in fact , her performance is better than freeman ' s , if that is even possible . her character is more original than freeman ' s , and she handles it wonderfully . we finally have a female character in a movie like this who does more than just scream . the supporting cast is highly underdeveloped , but the cast members do as much as they can with it . cary elwes portrays a cop in north carolina , and unfortunately has scraps for a character . tony goldwyn fairs slightly better , but we don ' t really get to know his character either . gina ravera gives a good performance , but again she isn ' t in many of the scenes . so as a result of all these small supporting parts , the weight of the film lies on the two leads , and they do a phenomenal job . some of the best acting of this genre , and some of the best acting of the year . two other essential aspects of the film are quite good . director gary fleder does a good job of controlling his actors , but the second half of the film loses believability , especially during the revelation of the killer . he also doesn ' t handle the suspenseful scenes as a better director would have , losing a lot of tension during many scenes . however , to his credit , he does manage a terrific first half . part of the blame falls on david klass . i ' m sure the book developed many of the lesser characters more , but klass focuses on the two main parts . while this may give the two leads more screentime , many of the small characters are one - dimensional , and the killer , when revealed , is extremely implausible . thanks to the smart dialogue adapted from the novel , kiss the girls always seems intelligent . none of the conversations are laughable , and all move the plot forward without seeming forced . one of the biggest problems i had with the movie was the motive of the killer . i blame this mainly on the casting director , because the killer ' s motive is because of rejection from women ( or so i assume from the opening monologue ) , but the killer himself is very attractive ( one of my friends is a , shall we say , big admirer of the killer ) . kiss the girls is rated r for terror , violence , language , and suggested sex . with all the implausibilities of this film , and with the mediocre second half , kiss the girls somehow manages to thoroughly entertain . in fact , i had the urge to see it again just for the performances . the cinematography adds a lot of mood to the already creepy tone , and the script is usually smart . this is clearly one of those movies which rely on the acting to pull it through . morgan freeman is possibly today ' s most convincing actor , and ashley judd adds another notch on her acting belt . i must also say that i loved the ending . the showdown between good and evil was quite tense , and the resolution of the scene makes almost anyone cheer . perhaps it may not be possible , but most of the film isn ' t anyway .\",\n",

( during the time the story takes place , many new nations , including nigeria and somalia , were born , with varying degrees of success and failure , usually dependent upon which country colonized them . some colonial masters were better than others . ) the effort involved in \" lumumba \" is quite ambitious as peck and his crew before and behind the camera strive to bring to life this slice of world history that might have gone unexplored for decades , if at all . production values are first rate on what must be a small , by us standards , budget . the period feel and realistic african settings are nicely maintained in a production that traveled from zimbabwe to mozambique . the screenplay covers a lot of ground and does yeoman \\' s work in providing a great deal of detailed history while trying to do justice to the story of lumumba \\' s life . the political side of things is evenly told in a linear , straightforward manner that teaches , not preaches . it concentrates on the good deeds of the man , if a bit as a stalwart saint , but doesn \\' t embellish on a larger than life persona . the family side of patrice \\' s life is handled in several , perfunctory and brief interludes that show him talking to one of his children , embracing his wife or lamenting the death of his child . i know the intent is to flesh the man out , but too short a shrift is given to the family man side of lumumba . the story , as such , has a lopsided feel about it . high marks go to eriq ebouaney as the title character . the actor gives a convincing , charismatic performance as the multifaceted , politically deft patrice lumumba who has the good of his people and his country as the force driving his own ambitions . in true docudrama tradition , the supporting cast does not outshine the star , complementing his good efforts , instead . \" lumumba \" is a solid , interesting , educational and honest docudrama that should appeal to film buffs and politicos , both . it has more intelligence in its telling than anything i \\' ve seen out of hollywood for months and i give it a b + .',\n",

' no doubt , they were impressed with judd ' s series of catwalks and disguise changes . the major problem with ` eye of the beholder ' is that the film jerks forward , always unsure of its ultimate destination . if it was a thriller , there was little to keep us entranced . if it was a love story , there was absolutely no emotional pull . completely disjointed in structure , it ' s only saving grace was its stylish look which reminded me of my favorite car commercial ( the one where the ` 6 ' on the tachometer dissolves into a winding road and a passenger rail car dissolves into a small miniature on a child ' s train set ) . i am also still hopeful that ashley judd will find a serious role to showcase her potential talents . beyond that , the film is hopelessly out - of - control and is in need of seriously better traction and handling .\",\n",

              " (\"bowfinger is a good movie about the making of a very bad one . the screenplay , written by co - star steve martin , skewers everything in hollywood from cheesy science - fiction movies to chop - socky fight sequences , and all in a crafty and accomplished manner . anyone who knows of , or has had any association with movie - making should thoroughly enjoy this clever comedy for it ' s entire duration . the central premise behind the film is an inspired and promising one . bobby bowfinger ( martin ) , a cheapskate and small - time hollywood producer , has always dreamed of making a successful motion picture but has never attained the proper tools to do so . a new script , an alien invasion story entitled chubby rain , has caught bowfinger ' s eye . after confronting a big - name producer named jerry renfro ( robert downey jr . ) in a restaurant , an agreement is made to finance the movie . but first , bowfinger must get renowned action star kit ramsey ( eddie murphy ) to sign in on the project . kit turns the offer down immediately , but bowfinger still has the intent to shoot the film . after emptying out his life savings , the hapless producer tells the remaining cast and crew that ramsey is involved , and then prepares to film the movie without the star ' s knowledge . the actors confront ramsey on the street , saying their lines as hidden cameras peek through bushes to capture the footage . the unknowing star , who is terrified of aliens and being abducted , is brought to believe there is actually pod people after him . when the conditions become even more treacherous , bowfinger is forced to hire a kit ramsey look - alike named jiff ( also murphy ) , a sweet - natured dork who runs for coffee in - between shooting vital scenes . these include attempting a suicide run across an 8 - lane freeway , and one of the ` hot ' scenes involving supporting actress daisy ( heather graham ) removing her blouse . bowfinger takes it ' s sweet time getting started , but when the plot switches into high gear , great things happen . certain scenes are so precisely executed , perfectly framing moments that are absolutely fall - down funny . no , hilarious . standouts include the chase through a parking garage in which ramsey , who ' s supposed to be being followed , keeps checking behind him to investigate a strange tapping noise ( it ' s actually bowfinger ' s dog in high heels ) . and just try not to laugh in the climactic kung - fu sequence , featuring jiff in an excerpt from another bowfinger classic entitled fake purse ninjas . while the entire 97 - minutes of bowfinger isn ' t always on target , individual scenes may have you rolling in the aisles . masterful comedy director frank oz ( dirty rotten scoundrels , in and out ) , who has never made a bad movie , ensures a quality final product and is aided immensely by martin ' s sharp - edged script . however , the real on - screen star is eddie murphy . this is the actor ' s finest work since his breakthrough into the hollywood market in the early 80 ' s . murphy excels at every corner , not only succeeding with presenting believable paranoia in the eyes of kit ramsey , but in creating a likable buffoon in jiff as well . these three talented comic minds have squeezed every morsel of potential out of this premise , and the reward is a virtually guaranteed helping of hearty laughs . steve martin generates the power behind bowfinger , but murphy fuels it . this is a summer - time comedy that , unlike something such as american pie and south park , doesn ' t break any rules . but it ' s still just as uproarious , or perhaps even more side - splitting than anything we ' ve seen this season . the supporting cast , including christine baranski as a work - loving actress and jamie kennedy as the cameraman , all perform well within their limits . the only presence that demands real attention when placed next to martin or murphy is the beautiful heather graham , as the young film star who has plans to sleep her way to the top . graham , attempting to further her stardom after appearing as the new powers ' girl in ap2 , displays a cheerful but naive persona that nicely corresponds with the wackiness of the screenplay . i wouldn ' t be caught dead buying a ticket for chubby rain , but watching how it all came about is certainly entertaining enough .\",\n",

what is a sham ? the film turns our very perception of life on its side . more than once , we are also presented with the question of whether we would rather know the harsh truth of reality , or live a life of relative bliss , oblivious to the true nature of our surroundings . as viewers , this is intriguing enough , so imagine what it would be like for neo . and who to better play a bewildered person than keanu reeves ? reeves , whom i \\' ve never really cared for as an actor , is competent in roles which require a lot of straightforwardness , and little subtlety . he was good in speed , for example , but laughably poor in a walk in the clouds . neo is actually one of those roles which reeves slips into rather nicely , so much of my expectation was happily for naught . in a couple of places , the script even capitalizes upon his wooden nature , and this is a heavy credit to writers / directors andy and larry wachowski . i mean , since bill and ted \\' s excellent adventure , what movie could you say really \" utilized \" keanu reeves ? more interesting than reeves is fishburne , who \\' s morpheus nearly runs the gamut of emotions , and convincingly so . very surprising for a sci - fi movie . fishburne also maintains a certain demeanor about himself throughout , as if he always knows what to expect . this helps to further the aura of his character \\' s proficiency and extensive knowledge . hugo weaving as agent smith , one of the artificial intelligence \\' s anti - intruder programs , is also good playing his deadpan , no - nonsense , kick ass role , which requires him to show emotion at the appropriate time . unfortunately , when weaving speaks for more than a few sentences in a row , the nature of his character \\' s speech pattern becomes a little more laughable than impressive . carrie - anne moss plays trinity , morpheus \\' s number one assistant who becomes somewhat of a love interest for neo . although her character is somewhat inconsistent , moss nevertheless delivers an above par performance when fishburne isn \\' t in the picture . there were few expenses spared when it comes to the special effects . many methods of imagery are employed , from modeling to bluescreen to computer graphics . of special note is the use of the \" freeze and turn \" effect where the entire scene is frozen , turned , then continued from a new angle . this is accomplished by using a large number of still cameras employed in a semi - circle , with motion picture cameras placed at the two ends . the motion cameras film the action , and at the appropriate moment all the still cameras fire at once . place each still image in a film sequence and you get a nearly seamless transition from the first motion camera to the second . pretty slick . the matrix drips with style . from the clothing to the music to the action , we \\' re watching an exaggerated version of what we \\' re used to . much of it seems like the combination of two genres of the hong kong action film - there \\' s a lot of kung fu , there \\' s a lot of gunplay . when a character is letting go with an automatic weapon , much is made of the empty cartridges falling to the floor in slow motion . there \\' s also the element of the japanese action cartoon ( called anime by aficionados ) , especially in the way the sequences are filmed in sweeping pans and emphasized actions through special effects . combined , it \\' s really like no live - action film i have ever seen . the film is not without its faults . some of the scenes and ideas are \" borrowed \" a little too liberally from other films , and one component of the ending is decidedly disappointing . some of the lines are also pretty bad - in one instance , a supporting character incorrectly delivers a famous saying , and it wasn \\' t meant to be a joke . however , these shortcomings detract little from what is an overall solid action sci - fi film that for once does more than merely entertain .',\n",

( sunderland actually asks brenner , \" why was she killed ? \" to which i would have answered , \" if i knew , then the movie would already be over . \" ) only after we \\' ve spent twenty minutes or so with these characters do we learn that they have a sordid history together ; this angle , though apparently present to develop their characters , is never explored . not that it really matters , since the characters consistently do ludicrous things for no other reason than to drive the plot . in one scene , sunderland is attacked by a man in a mask . she sees one of his rings , and she and brenner find the man later that day based on the ring . instead of questioning him like as they would a real suspect , they take him to brenner \\' s houseboat , beat him up , and pour hot coffee in his lap . this scene really pushed me over the edge , not because it \\' s gratuitous and mean - spirited , but because it illustrates the film \\' s complete disregard for the characters and the audience . it was impossible for me to feel anything for these people beyond this scene , mostly because nothing they do comes as a surprise . i realized that these constructs on screen aren \\' t actually characters , but devices present only to serve the story . this would have been bad enough without the west \\' s need to hose his movie down in tasteless images of rape and sexual misconduct . compelling films about sexual crimes don \\' t spend a lot of time on rape flashbacks , and they certainly don \\' t show as much skin and sweat as a typical pornographic picture . these scenes are not the least bit powerful ; on the contrary , they \\' re intended simply to provide the audience with the necessary resentment for the villain , whomever that may turn out to be . in addition , the movie treats sexual fetishes -- and sadomasochism in particular -- as if it \\' s a perversion of everything we know to be pure . this standpoint is certainly allowed , but only in accompaniment with well - developed themes to back it up . as it is , the film forgets that a lot of people have sexual fetishes , and that putting on a pair of handcuffs does not make a person insane . perhaps the only positive elements in the general \\' s daughter are a couple of the performances . james woods has a few terrific scenes , and plays his role with sharp , witty subtlety . i also liked james cromwell , mostly because he comes across as slightly sympathetic despite the obvious intent of west to make him villainous . nonetheless , these performances are undermined entirely by the dreary , obligatory atmosphere and the senseless neglect of characterization . the general \\' s daughter is the worst kind of hollywood film -- it pretends to have a soul , to be of strict moral code , when in fact it has nothing more than a group of cardboard cut - outs force - feeding the audience a toxic landfill of plot contrivances and one - sided moral judgments .',\n",

( don cheadle of \" boogie nights \" ) , who also becomes involved in bulworth \\' s campaign . some of the scenes in the ghetto ring true , but much of it feels like a lighter version of scenes depicted in more intense inner - city films like \" boyz \\' n \\' hood \" ( 1991 ) and \" menace ii society \" ( 1993 ) . \" bulworth \\' s \" chief liability is beatty \\' s insistence on having his character adopt a clumsy style of rap as his new communication device . instead of speaking at political rallies , he breaks into a kind of rhythmless rap style that is a reminder of why almost all hip - hop stars are black . it \\' s hard to tell whether beatty is being humorous by being so bad , or whether he \\' s actually that incompetent . at any rate , the rap sounds more run d . m . c . than snoop doggy dogg , which makes the film seem dated instead of contemporary . beatty would have been better off simply adopting some of the inner - city lingo and working that into his speeches , instead of trying to sound like l . l . cool j . other than that , \" bulworth \" hits all its targets with wry , hilarious accuracy . the film is like a letter bomb to the democratic party , and even if you don \\' t agree with beatty \\' s liberal message about the unrequited duties of the federal government , it is hard to deny the impact the film has in exploring the monetary and moral debauchery that infests modern politics . unlike \" primary colors \" which opened earlier this year , \" bulworth \" doesn \\' t try to tip - toe around the truly painful issues that hit close to home - instead , it takes them dead - on .',\n",

\" the film is about two individuals who have come together , spent a good chunk of their lives together , and shows when our main characters are \" him \" and \" her \" ( during the bad times ) , and when they are \" us \" ( during the good times ) . the story of us is about their entire 15 years of marriage that is collapsing day by day . ben and katie now only see and live with each other because they don \\' t want to devastate their children with the fact that their parents no longer , or at least say they don \\' t , love each other anymore . ben , a cartoonist , and katie , a crossword puzzle writer , have grown apart during their fifteen years of marriage , as they have grown to follow different views on life , family , and marriage . katie is the more organized , sophisticated type , who wants to plan everything out , while ben is a spontaneous , adventurous individual who doesn \\' t mind doing things differently than they were planned . the story of us plays out nicely , as the film opens with ben sharing his story with a therapist , told to the viewer through flashbacks . as the film progresses , it switches between ben and katie talking to their therapist , with their stories being told with flashbacks of their marriage . this method is highly effective , as we see the characters changing from year to year , slowly growing apart . through the flashbacks , we get to see the story of them through both of the character \\' s eyes , and this gives us a strong sense of what their characters are really like , as the story of us has three dimensional , believable main characters . the screenplay , written by jessie nelson ( stepmom ) and alan zweibel ( dragnet ) , is a touching , down to earth work that hits a chord within the viewer , much like another one of nelson \\' s films , stepmom . the script has an open honesty and outlook on life , one that is so realistic , you feel uncomfortable at many times , because so many situations the characters are in are undeniably familiar , as most families these days most go through the hard times , as ben and katie must . if it wasn \\' t for the first 15 minutes that the writers wrote , which are rugged and certainly flawed , the story of us would have been this year \\' s best picture . bruce willis , a usual action / adventure star , has certainly turned himself around in the past year - he went from being a man who was being typecast to the same role in action movies , to a distinguished , sophisticated actor , as in last summer \\' s the sixth sense ; and now in the story of us , willis shows the world what he can really do if he is fed a good script . although i wouldn \\' t pick willis as the choice actor for ben jordan , willis handles himself nicely , and shines in a few of the film \\' s most powerful scenes , enough that make his performance a definite contender comes awards season . where to start about michelle pfeiffer ? pfeiffer \\' s performance is spellbinding and ultimately strong , as she brings her character to life with such charisma and emotion , you wonder how , how it is possible for someone to portray a real person with such realism . pfeiffer \\' s performance is one that if not recognized by the academy next spring , will be in the heart \\' s of any viewer that has watched this moving film . the story of us is one of 1999 \\' s most real , yet funny films , as the razor sharp script evens out the laughs and the tears to keep the viewer hooked . superb acting , direction , writing , story , and soundtrack that always sets the mood for the film , which is beautifully composed by eric clapton and marc shaiman , make the story of us a touching , unforgettable motion picture that will touch the hearts of viewers across the country - and will certainly become one of the most talked about movies of the fall . the film \\' s major high points are the fights between ben and katie , as the two constantly accuse of each other of whose fault it is that their marriage has collapsed , and although they also say things like \" it \\' s over , \" or \" i hate you , \" you can tell the two still share a deep connection , and that inside , somewhere , they are still an \" us . \" the bottom line : a wonderful , enchanting , and heartbreaking film . one of the most realistic , heartbreaking films in recent years .',\n",

              " (\"would you believe -- in real life , i mean -- that if you were julia roberts , that you ' d be the ugly underdog to your sister , the creepy catherine zeta - jones ? let me tell you what reality is . reality is that you are megastar julia fricking roberts and your brother is eric roberts , and he picks up whatever crumbs of stardom fall off your coattails as you blaze across the sky in a golden chariot . that ' s reality . america ' s sweethearts is the opposite of reality , a train wreck that tries to sell julia as a scruffy also - ran , presumably because she wears horn - rimmed glasses and used to be overweight ( uh - huh ) . the plot follows two married , mega - movie stars , gwen and eddie ( zeta - jones and poor , poor john cusack , whose material gets worse every year ) , on the eve of their new star vehicle ' s release , a film called time over time . the only problem : gwen and eddie have gone through a nasty separation , and the press and public have not been forgiving ( think meg and dennis ) . gosh , and the director has vanished with the film , holding the only print hostage . veteran pr agent lee ( billy crystal ) is called upon to clean up the mess , throwing a press junket in the nevada desert to woo them with the story of a possible reconciliation between the gwen and eddie , presumably distracting the stupid , stupid film critics into forgetting they haven ' t seen the movie at all . ( note to sony : any studio executive that thinks this plot is going to win points with the reviewing press needs to check into rehab . ) and did i mention gwen ' s sister kiki ( roberts ) is along for the ride ? and that she and eddie just might fall in love along the way ? oh billy , you ' re a scamp ! the script you ' ve co - written with peter tolan ( what planet are you from ? and bedazzled -- need i say more ? ) is a roast of hollywood and celebrity , sure , but it ' s not a funny one . yes , crystal tells us , hollywood is lying to our faces ! if you are surprised by this , you might want to check on your subscription to people magazine . it ' s about to expire . aside from a scant few zingers ( yeah , se ? or winces rules ! ) , america ' s sweethearts ' jokes aren ' t funny , its pace is choppy , and the whole affair comes off as a vanity project -- not for headlining star julia roberts -- but for billy crystal to deliver a bunch of lame punch lines that he wrote himself . i didn ' t time it ( the movie ' s not that bad ) , but it ' s crystal who really has the most screen time and is the unequivocal focus of the film . bad move , billy -- your jokes suck . the crotch humor is outpaced only by the meanness of the movie ' s gags -- and with unsubtle sexual innuendo dripping from every scene , how this movie earned a pg - 13 rating is a mystery to me . julia overcame a lot of spiteful writing and acting to make my best friend ' s wedding into a winning film , but not even that 90 - tooth smile can save her here . obviously aware of the ugliness before him , director joe roth turns to goofy supporting characters like hank azaria ( as a lisping spaniard ) , christopher walken ( the insane time over time director ) , and alan arkin ( a new age guru in a fright wig ) to crack wise . none of the stereotypes is successful except for walken ; azaria comes off as a preening queen when he ' s supposed to be macho . as for roth , in case you don ' t know , went from direcing revenge of the nerds ii to launching his own movie studio , revolution , which produced this work . he ' s back behind the camera for the first time in 11 years . it ' ll probably be another 11 before he ' s back again . i could drone on about how america ' s sweethearts will only appeal to the mouth - breathing morons who talk on their cell phones during the movies , but that would get old . instead , i ' ll settle for discussing the movie ' s worst sin : that sweethearts is painfully contrived and wholly unbelievable , not just in its plot but in its sentiment . every single character in this film ( with the arguable exception of kiki ) is simply hateful , and putting them in a romantic comedy is a waste of a bunch of villains . when you leave the theater , you ' ll ask yourself , too : why would i want any of these jerks to be happy ?\",\n",

              " ('when i saw the trailer for this film , i laughed harder than i had in quite some time . while i was therefore pretty well psyched to see it , i was ever mindful that a trailer can make even the most mediocre film look good . i \\' m happy to say that there \\' s something about mary is not one of those trailer let - downs . in fact , watching this film was quite a fine way to spend two hours . the film opens up in flashback to 1985 , at a high school in cumberland , rhode island . ted stroehmann ( ben stiller ) is a social reject who can \\' t seem to get a date to the upcoming prom , until he comes to the defense of the mentally retarded warren ( w . earl brown ) , who \\' s being harassed by one of the school jocks . it seems warren \\' s sister is the campus queen , mary jensen ( cameron diaz ) , who is impressed with ted \\' s willingness to stand up for her defenseless brother , despite a very real chance of getting beaten up . mary takes an immediate liking to ted and asks him to the prom . ted was just flattered that she even knew his name . unfortunately , prom night is ruined when ted has an accident with his zipper ( at which every man in the theater will wince ) , and is sent to the hospital . fast forward to the present , where ted has cleaned himself up , now writes for a magazine , but has weekly therapy sessions in order to deal with his obsession of the past 13 years : mary , whom he hasn \\' t seen since that fateful day . with the help of his friend dom ( chris elliott ) , ted hires slimy private investigator pat healy ( matt dillon ) to track down his only love . however , when pat finds mary , he falls for her too , and soon the both of them are competing for her affections . there \\' s something about mary is directed by bobby and peter farrelly , who brought us dumb and dumber and kingpin . not exactly intelligent comedies , they are of the guilty pleasure variety where you might not want your friends or co - workers to think you had such a great time watching them . with their current film , the farrelly brothers have come up with something you \\' ll not only enjoy , but also won \\' t mind talking about the next day at the water cooler . the film succeeds in employing a pretty wide range of comedic styles , from the subtle to the ridiculous , and while a few of the gags might be offensive to some ( seeming like residuals from the farrelly brothers \\' last two films ) they almost all work . i have not seen many movies in the recent past that shoot for the mark and so often hit it dead on . one minute you \\' ll be laughing at something ted says , and the next you \\' ll be howling at the sight of a dog dragging him across the floor of mary \\' s apartment . one of the great things this film has going for it is ben stiller . he is perfectly cast in the role of ted , because he \\' s a guy who just looks awkward in almost every situation . ted \\' s a nice fellow and tries to do his best , but for some reason or another things just don \\' t always work out . it \\' s comical , but also has that kind of appeal where you really feel for the him and want him to come out on top . actually , i \\' ve liked stiller since he did a short which aired on saturday night live back in the mid - eighties . the film was like a theatrical trailer for a spoof on the tom cruise / paul newman film the color of money , entitled the hustler of money . in it , stiller played wince ( not vince ) who is taken under the wing of an older man ( played by john mahoney ) to become a big - time bowling hustler . it was parody at its finest , more of which showed up in the short - lived \" the ben stiller show \" on the fox network in late \\' 92 / early \\' 93 . like \" the critic \" ( which aired on abc , then fox ) , i still mourn that show \\' s cancellation . cameron diaz is absolutely enchanting for most of the film , although her character seems obsessed with perfection in the men she dates , and some of the qualities she looks for make mary look paper - thin at times . however , diaz pulls the role off with such panache and charm , that you can still see why she \\' s got guys just falling over each other to be with her . heck , i even found her laugh to be cute , even though i thought it was annoying during an appearance she made on the tonight show last week . my girlfriend remarked that matt dillon doesn \\' t change , and you know , it \\' s really true . he and ralph macchio must hang out or something . maybe they live in dick clark \\' s pool house . anyway , here \\' s another good piece of casting , as dillon slips beautifully into the role of the guy who tries to worm his way into mary \\' s heart . the supporting performances are also good . chris elliott has a bigger part than in the abyss ( yes , check it out next time ) , and less annoying than in cabin boy . lin shae , who plays mary \\' s neighbor magda ( and also appeared as the landlady in kingpin ) , provides some good laughs , especially in scenes with her benji - like dog , which acts as the focal point for a few of the funniest moments of the film . lee evans , as mary \\' s friend tucker , displays a flexibility in acting and accents which surprises and contributes to an interesting plot twist . the farrelly brothers and scriptwriters ed decter and john j . strauss keep the comedic pacing going so that there aren \\' t any noticeable times where the film drags . the only problem i saw was their use of a couple of musicians who provide segues between several key scenes . they appear out of nowhere and actually sing plot - relevant information right toward the camera . it \\' s a device which was amusing for about three seconds when they opened the film . after that it got a little annoying , and it \\' s unfortunate that those spots interrupt what would otherwise be a smooth flow . fortunately , filled with sight gags , humorous lines , and solid comedic acting , there \\' s something about mary will still have you laughing after you leave the theater .',\n",

              " ('one of the most blatantly obvious signs that often - acclaimed director sidney lumet \\' s \" gloria , \" a remake of the 1980 john cassavetes film , had absolutely no effect on me occurred when i was driving home from the theatre . suddenly , i realized that since i had stood up from my theatre seat five minutes before , i had not thought once about the film i had just invested nearly two hours of my life in . when a movie is over , aren \\' t we supposed to think about it for a while , and have a conversation about it with the acquaintances we have just watched it with ? i thought so , but , for one , i saw this particular picture by myself , and # 2 , even if i had been with someone there wouldn \\' t have been anything to talk about in the first place . to be sure , \" gloria \" begins with a stirring , rather poignant prologue in which a seven - year - old boy \\' s family is brutally gunned down by mobsters , in search of a disc his father had with incriminating evidence on it . right before the men broke in , of course , his father gave him the disc to escape with . eventually , the boy , named nicky nunez ( jean - luke figueroa ) , is caught by the mobsters , and taken back to their apartment . meanwhile , gloria ( sharon stone ) has just gotten out of prison for a crime she didn \\' t commit and returns to her ex - boyfriend ( jeremy northam ) to recieve the money he promised her for covering up his crime . when he refuses to give it to her , and then hears the group of men talking about killing nicky , she leaves with him in order to save his life , but not before holding the men at gunpoint , stealing all of their money , and forcing them to strip nude . gloria is the type of fast - talking , smart - mouthed new yorker who always seems to get involved with the wrong people , and she never expected to be stuck with a kid , but she has a heart of gold ( don \\' t they always in this type of movie ) and is only trying to protect the boy , whom she quickly begins to form a close bond with . the previous incarnation of \" gloria \" by cassavetes and starring the luminous gena rowlands , remains unseen by me , but was no doubt superior , even though i can \\' t really imagine how this considerably dull story could be transformed into an entertaining one , regardless of the director or stars . there is no doubt in my mind that director lumet has stuck closely to the original , but the film itself is simply lifeless , with only an occasional laugh popping up here and there so that it isn \\' t completely unbearable to watch . i liked , for example , a very funny climactic sequence where gloria is deciding whether to leave the school she has left the boy at , and keeps turning the car around , then driving a little ways , then slamming on the brakes and turning around again . these bright moments , however , appear long and far between , and the majority of the film deals with the budding relationship between nicky and gloria , which is both painfully predictable and by - the - numbers . throughout , my mind was repeatedly asking the question , \" who really cares ? \" as gloria , sharon stone has adopted an over - the - top brooklyn accent that honestly doesn \\' t sound realistic at all . in the beginning , in fact , i was amazed at how amateurish stone \\' s performance was , but as the film progressed she got better . although not one of her better turns , stone does have a comic flare that refuses to be ignored . jean - luke figeroa was fine as nicky and a little more natural than the usual child actors who are so precocious they make you want to gag . all other actors who appeared were considerably wasted , none more than cathy moriarty , an entertaining actress in her own right , who is billed fourth and has all of one scene , as gloria \\' s friend whom she turns to for help . sony , the studio that released \" gloria , \" obviously does not have any faith in the film , and i don \\' t blame them . they declined to screen the picture for critics , which is never a good sign , particularly with the high - profile people involved . although how much money a movie makes does not determine how good it is ( just look at the spectacular \" in dreams , \" which failed to even make the top 10 last week ) , i have a suspicion \" gloria \" is going to vanish from theaters faster than \" ishtar , \" judging from the opening night 7 : 00 p . m . showing i saw it at , where there were about ten to fifteen people present , counting myself . although stone can be an impressive actress ( just watch her in 1995 \\' s \" casino \" or 1996 \\' s \" last dance \" if you don \\' t believe me ) and sidney lumet can be a respectable director , there is no reasoning for why they thought the cliched story of \" gloria \" was worth remaking or , for that matter , why columbia pictures agreed to finance it when they could have been making a picture that actually looked like it might have an inkling of a chance to be successful .',\n",

              " (\"in the opening shot of midnight cowboy , we see a close - up of a blank movie screen at a drive - in . we hear in the soundtrack human cries and the stomping of horses ' hooves . without an image projected onto the screen , the audience unerringly identifies the familiar sound of cowboys chasing indians and can spontaneously fill in the blank screen with images of old westerns in our mind ' s eye . even without having seen a cowboys and indians movie , somehow the cliched images of them seem to have found their way into our mental schema . but do cowboys really exist , or are they merely hollywood images personified by john wayne and gary cooper ? exploring this theme , director john schlesinger uses the idea of the cowboy as a metaphor for the american dream , an equally cliched yet ambiguous concept . is the ease at which salvation and success can be attained in america a hallmark of its experience or an urban legend ? midnight cowboy suggests that the american dream , like image of the cowboy , is merely a myth . as joe buck migrates from place to place , he finds neither redemption nor reward in his attempt to create a life for himself , only further degeneration . during the opening credits , joe walks past an abandoned theater whose decrepit marquee reads ` john wayne : the alamo . ' as joe is on the bus listening to a radio talk show , a lady on the air describes her ideal man as ` gary cooper ? but he ' s dead . ' a troubled expression comes across joe ' s face , as he wonders where have all the cowboys gone . having adopted the image of a cowboy since youth , joe now finds himself deserted by the persona he tried to embody . joe ' s persistence in playing the act of the cowboy serves as an analogue to his american dream . he romanticizes about making it in the big city , but his dreams will desert him as he is forced to compromise his ideals for sustenance . by the end of midnight cowboy , joe buck loses everything and gains nothing . just as the audience can picture cowboys chasing indians on a blank screen , we can also conjure up scenes from pretty woman as paradigms of american redemption and success . but how realistic are these ideals ? joe had raped and been raped in texas . the scars of his troubled past prompt him to migrate to new york , but he does not know that his aspirations to be a cowboy hero will fail him there just as they had in texas . alongside the dream of success is the dream of salvation . the ability to pack up one ' s belongings and start anew seems to be an exclusive american convention . schlesinger provides us with strong hints as to joe ' s abusive and abused past with flashbacks of improper relationships with crazy anne and granny . we understand that joe adopts the fa ? ade of a cowboy , a symbol of virility and gallantry , as an attempt to neutralize his shame . he runs from his past only to be sexually defiled this time by his homosexual experiences in new york . in the scene at the diner which foreshadows joe ' s encounter with the gay student , joe buck spills ketchup on himself . standing up , we see the ketchup has made a red stain running from the crotch of his pants down his thigh . schlesinger visually depicts the degeneration of joe ' s virility by eliciting an image of bleeding genitals , signifying emasculation . beyond the symbol of castration , the scene may also connote the bleeding of a virgin ' s first sexual encounter , a reference to joe ' s first homosexual liaison . the fact that the idea of a bleeding virgin is relegated only to females furthers the imagery of joe ' s emasculation . it is ironic that joe has trouble prospecting for female clients , but effortlessly attracts men . joe believes his broncobuster getup is emblematic of his masculinity ; new yorkers see his ensemble as camp and ` faggot stuff . ' there are two predominant images of new york . the first is that new york is the rich , cosmopolitan city where hope and opportunity are symbolized by the tall skyscrapers and the statue of liberty . the other new york is travis bickle ' s new york , a seedy , corruptive hell on earth . joe envisions new york as the former , but is presented with the latter . mirroring the irony in which joe envisions his cowboy attire as masculine , he mistakenly buys into the fable that new york is filled with lonely women neglected by gay men . joe thinks he is performing a great service for new york , but the city rapes him of his pride and possessions . the people steal joe ' s money , the landlord confiscates his luggage , and the homosexuals rob him of his dignity . what has become of joe ' s american dream ? schlesinger responds to this question with the scene at the party . joe gets invited to a shindig of sorts and at the gathering is exposed to a dizzying array of food , drugs , and sex . at the party , all of joe and ratzo ' s desires are made flesh ; joe flirts successfully with women and ratzo loads up on free salami . contrasting joe ' s daily struggles , shots of warhol ' s crew display wanton indulgence . there is an irreverence in the partygoers ' attitude ; we see a shot of a woman kowtowing to nothing in particular , orgies breaking out in the periphery , and drugs passed around like party favors . the party makes a mockery of joe ' s ideals . joe believed that hard work and persistence were the elements for success in america ; scenes of the party and his rendezvous with shirley suggest that it is the idle who profit from joe ' s toils . the american dream , schlesinger suggests , is merely a proletarian fantasy , for those who are content no longer dream , but become indolent . as joe heads to miami , all that was significant of the cowboy image has left him . his masculinity is compromised and his morality is relinquished . for joe , nothing is left of the cowboy hero and commensurately , he surrenders the identity . tossing his boots into the garbage , he returns to the bus for the last leg of his journey to miami . the final shot of midnight cowboy shows joe inside the bus , more introspective , taking only a few glances outside the window . instead of the frequent pov shots of joe excitedly looking out of the bus on his way to new york , schlesinger sets up this final shot from the exterior of the bus looking in through the window at joe . reflections of the palm trees ratzo so raved about run across the bus ' window with joe hardly taking notice . the scenery of miami no longer exacts the same excitement from joe as before . the world seems smaller to joe now ; the termination of his journey coincides with the termination of his american dream . no longer does joe aspire to be the enterprising gigolo ; he resolves to return to a normal job and resign to basic means . midnight cowboy presents two familiar incarnations of the american dream . there is the frontier fantasy that if you are brave enough to repel a few indians , you can set up a ranch out west and raise a beautiful family . then there is the jay gatsby dream that a man of humble stock , with perseverance , can make a fortune in the big city . joe ' s attempt to realize these dreams robs him of his innocence in texas and morality in new york . during his search for an intangible paradise , joe ends up raping a girl and killing a man . an allegory of chasing the promise of the american dream , joe buck ' s progressive moral atrophy is a warning against the pursuit of illusory icons .\",\n",

[ theater rating : * * * : good seats , sound , and picture ] there are many philosophies as to why we are so fascinated with cartoons . they provide a method of total escapism in which anything will work within their context , from the outrageous slapstick of looney tunes to the intensity of japanimation . watching \" flubber \" really clinched this idea for me , because it \\' s just a live action cartoon that presents itself as a regular comedy . it proves how painfully unfunny all those gags and slapstick would be in reality , and how important it is to actually have a story . the film wastes no time in establishing its lighthearted , cartoony atmosphere . we meet medfield college chemistry professor phillip brainard ( williams ) , the typical , supposedly likable mad scientist . within the first 10 minutes we get at least a half dozen jokes about how forgetful he is . phillip \\' s memory loss seems less like a cartoony gag and more like a real case of alzhiemer \\' s disease - isn \\' t this rather lowbrow comedy ? he starts teaching chemistry after walking in on a nude figure drawing class ( an inappropriate joke for a kids \\' movie if i ever saw one ) . we learn he has stood his up fiancee , sara ( harden ) , twice at the altar simply because he \\' s forgotten . sara claims to love him , but says if he forgets the wedding again she \\' ll stop loving him ( a sign of childish attitude the film denies it has ) . but even cartoons must have conflicts to resolve , and it \\' s no surprise the major conflicts here are related . christopher mcdonald does and even worse version of his usual villain shtick as wilson croft , a scientist who not only wants to steal phillip \\' s ideas , but his woman too . what \\' s worse is that sara actually seems interested in him ! wilson works for a rival college that wants to buy out medfield , which is going broke , unless phillip can invent something to save the day . one of the first rules of filmmaking is to make sure the title has something to do with the film . the flubber is played for gags after it is introduced , but is all but forgotten about thereafter . it \\' s obvious phillip is going to accidentally invent flubber , a flying rubber compound that yields tremendous energy , and the promotions make the flubber look realistic and funny . unfortunately , the flubber , like all the special effects in this film , looks very fake and unconvincing . flubber also seems to have intelligence and a personality , and by the time it performs a song and dance routine , you give up wondering how life could spontaneously come to an inanimate object . most of the film wanders aimlessly as it relies on the flubber to make for the comedy ( since phillip \\' s absent - mindedness is forgotten about ) and somehow push the story along . but it \\' s clear how weak this premise is from the get - go and the film just gets worse . all the jokes involve people getting hit by fast - moving , flubber - powered objects including : bowling balls ; flying cars that don \\' t fly well ; and a basketball team capable of jumping 100 feet into the air . it \\' s all presented with complete logic , and no one believes flubber exists even when they see it with their own eyes . during the basketball scene , the coach for the rival team actually says , \" i think they might be cheating , \" to which the referee replies , \" there \\' s no rules about jumping too high . \" \" predictable \" doesn \\' t begin to describe the motions the film goes through , especially after the halfway point . and it \\' s not how terribly contrived the plot is , it \\' s the way it \\' s broken down scene - by - scene , with absolutely no transition . not only that , but all the actors here , especially williams , seem bored to tears . i \\' d say 80 percent of all the scenes were shot with a bluescreen , so it \\' s almost forgivable when you realize they \\' re talking to nothing and interacting with nothing . it \\' s safe to say everything that could be bad about \" flubber \" is . the only original element the film has is the world \\' s first romance between a machine and a human . but this aspect is quite twisted if you think about it , and , like the rest of the film , you won \\' t .',\n",

i know that the slasher film is not a particularly intelligent genre , but ben willis has got to go down as one of the most silly slashers in mainstream horror . come on , the guy looks like the gorton \\' s fisherman , and his gruff voice makes him sound like a disney pirate . though his lightning - lit appearances ellicited much - needed laughter in the theater , his appearance borders on the absurd in the horror film , and that \\' s * really * saying something . so , all that \\' s left to talk about here is jennifer love hewitt and brandy . both prance about in tightfitting , revealing outfits or in various states of undress , yet neither of them ever actually do a nude scene . hewitt , however , does do a post - shower scene in which her thin bathrobe is quite . . . titillating . this scene alone made this one - star turkey earn two stars under my rating system . otherwise , hewitt and brandy both grate on the nerves . early in the film , for instance , brandy wins the trip to the bahamas . she and hewitt jump around and scream and screech for what seems like forever . i needed extra - strength tylenol after that part . oh , and the film \\' s conclusion , talk about repetitive ! people who saw i know what you did last summer will predict i still know \\' s ending at least 5 minutes before it happens . boring ! i saw this movie with my brother at the local downtown movie theater . admission is only one dollar on wednesdays , and we often go see bad movies on these days just to ridicule them . it \\' s usually a fun thing to do along with the rest of the audience , who don \\' t seem to mind participating in a mass \" mystery science theater 3000 \" - type viewing . i still know what you did last summer , however , produced several lengthy uncomfortable silences from the audience , underscoring how bad it * really * is . if it weren \\' t for the main actresses \\' revealing wardrobes , i \\' d have had a very , very hard time sitting through this lame sequel . i can \\' t imagine trying to watch it on video ( horror films seem 10 times better in a theater because they rely heavily on audience participation ) and wouldn \\' t recommend it to people , unless they \\' re horror film fanatics or huge fans of hewitt and brandy . i read on a website somewhere that another sequel is already in the works . what a depressing thought . hewitt apparently needs to spend more time on tv figuring out how to act . rated r , this film contains lots of violence , several gory scenes , and a couple nubile , horny teenagers -- though the sex act itself is always thwarted . i \\' d say this is unsuitable for kids , but teens wouldn \\' t have a problem sitting through it , especially since they obviously compose the film \\' s target audience .',\n",

why did tim robbins \\' character have to go outside the ship when the solution easily presented itself from inside ? shouldn \\' t the astronauts be better trained to deal with a hull breach ? why are the characters such idiots ? because the script makes little attempt to properly develop them . all the \" conflict \" is clumsily delivered in excruciatingly obvious exposition in the opening scene ( which rips off orson welles and robert altman by utilizing a long opening tracking shot ) during which the characters repeatedly tell each other about things all of them should already know : \" jim , it \\' s too bad you can \\' t go on this mission because you were determined \\' psychologically inadequate \\' because your wife died right before you were to go on the mission together \" -- does anyone really talk like this ? can \\' t we find out these things in a less grating matter , like maybe in a flashback ? the whole film is like that . the filmmakers are not content to merely show us something and assume we know what \\' s going on ; they must * tell * us exactly what we \\' re looking at * every * time . sample dialogue from the film : ( shot of mars ) astronaut a : \" look , there \\' s mars \" astronaut b : \" you sure that \\' s mars ? \" astronaut a : \" yeah , that \\' s mars all right . \" astronaut c : \" hey , are you guys looking at mars ? \" that exchange isn \\' t actually in \" mission to mars , \" but i wouldn \\' t be surprised if it were . for all their cribbing from kubrick , spielberg , james cameron , and even ron howard , the makers of this film haven \\' t learned to do something all those directors did very well : show and don \\' t tell . de palma used to know how , but seems to have forgotten . this is mentally - challenged filmmaking ; they assume the audience won \\' t get what \\' s going on , so they explain everything five times over . fourth - graders may appreciate this , but more learned viewers will have their intelligence insulted . the principal actors sleepwalk their way through \" mission to mars , \" never managing to do away with an apparent \" i \\' m just here to get a paycheck \" attitude . cheadle stumbles over his awkward lines . armin mueller - stahl manages to thoroughly embarrass himself in an unbilled cameo . robbins puts his game face on and phones in his standard \" decent guy \" performance . and sinise hams it up with \" wistful \" facial expressions while watching tapes of his dead wife ( played by kim delaney , who only has one scene during which she still manages to deliver some ridiculous dialogue in a heavy - handed monologue about the meaning of life ) , and especially during the stolen - from - no - less - than - three - movies ( a lollipop to whoever names them ) conclusion , which combines endless , obvious explanation and sub - par cgi effects with gagging sentimentality and is sure to alienate any viewers who had been enjoying the show up until then . and of course , these aliens from mars who facilitated the evolution of life on earth are entirely different from the aliens in \" 2001 \" who facilitated the evolution of life on earth ; those aliens were from an * unknown * world . it could be said that fans of brainless action films might enjoy \" mission to mars , \" but such a comment ignores the fact that the film is also incredibly slow - going . leisurely pacing might have helped a film with a little more substance to it , but all of the substance of \" mission to mars \" has been stolen from other films , and those other films dealt with their ideas in a much more thoughtful fashion and generally contained more engaging characters . supposedly we \\' re intended to choke up when one character decides not to return home at the end of this one ( totally different from the one - character - decides - not - to - return ending of \" armageddon \" ) , but i suspect most people will either be laughing or groaning . me , i alternated between the two . there is only one good thing about the way \" mission to mars \" finally ends : the fact that the movie is over .',\n",

              " (\"it was only a matter of time before a dilbert - esque office comedy hit the screens . however , rather than coming from dilbert creator scott adams , office space is instead based on the work of another animator , mike judge , creator of beavis and butthead and king of the hill . in his live - action directoral debut , judge aptly spoofs corporate culture . the story is certainly not very involved , but there is plenty of truth and humor to fill the gaps . peter ( ron livingston ) is a programmer working at the initech corporation . every day in his mundane life is worse than the one before . . . in other words , every day is the worst day in his entire life . he ' s stuck in a boring job with eight different supervisors , all obsessed with administrative trivialities . he ' s smitten with joanna ( jennifer aniston ) , a local waitress , but hasn ' t the guts to even introduce himself . everything has simply made him a complete , nervous wreck . but all of that changes when , after an unintentionally over - effective visit to a hypnotherapist , peter loses all of his inhibitions . he realizes his lifelong dream : to do absolutely nothing . he begins to blatantly disregard the nonsensical instructions of his boss , bill lumbergh ( gary cole ) , doing whatever he feels like . peter ' s friends and co - workers , samir ( ajay naidu ) and michael bolton ( david herman ) . . . no , not that michael bolton , are perplexed by their friend ' s sudden change in attitude . but , they have larger things to worry about : rumors about that initech is about to begin downsizing . . . as bleak as much of this sounds , let me assure you that office space is a comedy , and quite a funny one . although it shares the same absurdist office humor of the dilbert comic strip , office space is actually based loosely on the series of milton cartoons which aired on saturday night life . each mundane detail , taken by itself , seems completely , regrettably , plausible . yet , when combined into a whole , the picture which results is absolutely surreal . ron livingston tackles his role straight - faced , and becomes much funnier because of it . his character isn ' t simply being a clown lampooning around the office , but rather seems possessed by a zen - like clarity . he is operating on a higher plane , where everything suddenly makes sense , and from this vantage point , he allows the audience to smirk at the absurdities of life . anyone who has had to deal with the inefficiencies of corporate bureaucracy , or who has ever been frustrated with the technology of modern life , will recognize many of the characters and situations in the film . in fact , in addition to being wildly humorous , the film may actually prove to be cathartic . the animated roots of office space show in the film ' s lack of complexity . most of the characters in the film can be quickly summarized by a particular personality quirk . one employee , milton ( stephen root ) , is practically a flesh - and - blood cartoon . however , despite their simple nature , the characters still manage to be surprisingly funny . it ' s not required to have a corporate background to enjoy this film ( though the situations may seem exceedingly far - fetched if you are unfamiliar with just how close to reality they really are ) . the film is flimsy and absurd , but also very funny .\",\n",

              " ('plot summary : the year is 2024 . the ozone layer has long since gone and the earth is now protected from radiation by a shield invented by connor mccleod . the shield , although saving lives , has made the atmosphere hot and humid . connor is a mortal and a tired old man who has given up hope . on returning from the opera one night connor is accosted by the leader of a \" terrorist \" organisation . they have tried to find out what the company that now runs the shield unit are covering up . connor is then attacked by two assassins sent by katana from the planet zeist ( like zeit -- get it ? ) . they fail and connor becomes immortal again by chopping their heads off . he then brings ramirez back to life in glencoe in scotland . both ramirez and connor are rebel leaders back on zeist and have been sent to earth as punishment . connor now has the option to return being the last one but opts to stay with his new found immortality and fight to find out about the company and the shield . katana meanwhile , fearing connor would return , sets out himself to kill the highlander . if you have never seen it . being a fan of highlander and mr . connery , i was in the cinema as soon as i could to see highlander ii : the quickening . i wish it had been quicker . i feel whatever else you can say about a film ( bad script bad music , etc . ) if you sit just plain bored through most of it then nothing much else needs to be said . the film was short but in my opinion only twelve minutes or so ( the time mr . connery is on the screen for ) is worth watching . the plot sounds a little ridiculous but i was willing to give it a chance . maybe they could pull it off . instead , i find that the characters have completely changed from those in the first film . it \\' s as if they are different people with the same names . witness connor jumping into bed with the leader of the resistance -- where is the attitude of \" who wants to live forever , when love must die \" gone to ? the love sub - plot * must * have had footage cut out . the highlander and ramirez both seemed aware of powers they had never mentioned before . putting our heroes in deadly situations and then having them walk away because of some new power is very annoying . i still want to know why connor \\' s coat becomes flame proof when he is immortal ! we are not given enough time on zeist to believe in it , nor are we told why advanced aliens still use swords to kill . why not dynamite or laser saws or just plain bullets followed by a quick chop to the neck ? i know the head needs to come off but you could at least immobilise your opponent with laser rifles first . to be fair one assassin tried this but he must be the world \\' s worst shot . meanwhile connor develops luke - skywalker - like powers of laser beam deflection . as for \" bad guys , \" we see a rebellion on zeist , crushed easier than a grape and then the rest of the plot depends on katana being obsessed with killing mccleod in case he returns to zeist . two assassins are sent , presumably they are meant to be good at killing but an aged connor kills them both with no problems . no more assassins are sent . katana , supposedly a very powerful man goes himself to kill connor . has he no more assassins ? has he no better ? why was the rebellion crushed so easily then ? michael ironside is totally unconvincing ( bring back the kurgan ) . he seems like a cartoon character and really isn \\' t that evil , just stupid and violent . we see the hollywood trick of the chief nasty threatening a child again and killing lots of innocents . yet he still seems like no threat -- perhaps because he seems too stupid to threaten connor , or maybe because his two best assassins wouldn \\' t have been amiss with larry , curly and mo . so much for plot and characters . the music is atrocious . it is at best intrusive and at worst annoying . bring back queen . there was an audible sigh ( of relief ? ) when connor played a queen track in a juke box . i believe this at least is to be corrected for the american release . the acting is at best flat , except for mr . connery . lambert is uninteresting and when he delivered \" there can be only one \" this time around it just made me wish there had only been one -- highlander . michael ironside is unconvincing ; sorry , michael , i usually like you and everyone else was incredibly forgetable . so why 2 / 10 ? visually the film is interesting at all times . it has a blade runner feel to it and some of the special effects are quite stunning . add to this an irrepressible sean connery who smiles throughout the whole film -- or is he smirking to himself ? his lines and delivery might make the film worthwhile had it not been so obvious that he cannot take the whole thing seriously at all but hey -- * i \\' d * have done it for 12 million . oh , and i agree with a previous reviewer , she * does * look like sharon stone but i believe it is her first film . incidentally there is a line producer credited and i hear rumours of highlander iii : the wizard .',\n",

              " (\"i didn ' t hate the big hit , even though it is a stupefyingly terrible film . for the entirety of its running time , my eyes were attached to the screen , and i never once got bored . i found the film interesting because of its unique awfulness : this is such a confused disaster of a film that it ' s entertaining to watch it in the same way that it ' s entertaining to witness a thirty car pileup on a freeway spaghetti bowl . as a narrative , the big hit is pure garbage , never truly deciding its genre and constantly crossing all kinds of boundaries . it reminded me a lot of grosse pointe blank , which is a similar film that fails in a lot of the same ways . it ' s fine to mix genres , if the film makers know what they ' re doing . unfortunately , writer ben ramsey and director kirk wong don ' t seem to know how to handle the material , and the result is an action film that wants to be a comedy . the biggest problem with the amalgamation , in this case , is that the film is absurd and the comedy is out of place . but it sure is a fascinating failure . marky . . . er , mark wahlberg stars as melvin surley , a hitman . he ' s a good hitman , apparently , although his tactics seem a bit rambunctious ( he doesn ' t snipe or make clean kills -- he just kicks the door down and shoots everything ) . he works with a few other hitmen -- cisco ( lou diamond phillips ) , crunch ( bokeem woodbine ) , and vinnie ( antonio sabbato , jr . ) . they ' re a nice bunch of muscular guys , who stand around in the locker room after working out and compare masturbation to sex . they all work for a man named paris ( avery brooks ) , who is rich , powerful , and in constant need of four sloppy hitmen . it is very important that they never go beyond their boss and do work on their own ; this , of course , is where the plot comes in . they decide to kidnap a young japanese girl named keiko ( china chow ) , who has a rich father . when they do this , it turns out she is paris ' . . . goddaughter ! it ' s very bad to have paris against you . the story is standard action film stuff . it ' s nothing new , and nothing particularly offensive ( but certainly not the slightest bit compelling ) . clearly the major selling point of the big hit is that it ' s a john woo - type of action film mixed in with some really hip comedy . it ' s true that a lot of the action sequences resemble recent films that go for the same idea ( such as face / off and the replacement killers , which are both far superior ) . there are stunts that are fun to watch : the opening sequence has melvin and two of his partners going in to kill some guy who has nothing to do with the story . they use night vision goggles and really powerful handguns . melvin is also very good at breakdancing , and uses this talent to avoid bullets and knives . like i said , it ' s not boring ; most disasters aren ' t . what makes it so bad is its genre - shifting madness . it seems to start out as a quirky - but - realistic action comedy , as melvin is seen transporting bags of human remains . then , as soon as they go to their first hit , it turns into a music video with bodies and bullets flying everywhere . then , somewhere in between , it turns back into comedy . keiko turns out to be a spunky little girl ; in one amusing scene , she is forced to read a letter out loud , indicating that she has been kidnapped , but the letter is littered with grammatical errors that skew the meaning of the words . and scenes like this work alone , but wong applies this goofy tone to scenes that should be more serious , or not be in the film at all . one of the most irritating moments has paris ordering cisco to come up to his office after he learns that keiko has been kidnapped ; when cisco gets there , paris and his men are standing around as if they knew cisco did it , but they let him out of there , telling him to find the perpetrator . the scene is played for laughs , but it isn ' t funny . and since it doesn ' t quite work as a comedy , it tries to fall back on the action , which also fails . this is a film where people fly fifteen feet backwards when shot with a handgun . cars land on tree branches and are supported by them . characters betray each other without a second thought . grenades are thrown in tight places . people jump out of tall buildings and survive . people outrun tumbling cars , and get out of the way of falling objects in small fractions of seconds . most frustrating of all , though , is the film ' s definition of a hit man : these guys are anything but subtle , quiet , and skilled individuals . they ' re more like socially depraved militia men ( melvin has an extensive collection of firearms in his garage , including missile launchers and hand - held machineguns ) . the characters each have one trait that distinguishes them from the rest ; this obviously doesn ' t make for deep or interesting people to watch . the acting is kind of fun , though -- wahlberg is a good actor , and his innocuous presence in this film is charming in a silly sort of way . phillips certainly has fun with his psychotic character , while christina applegate , who plays melvin ' s fianc ? e , is convincingly air - headed . the big hit is an action film that unknowingly spoofs itself in trying to be funny . the funniest parts are supplied by the actors , and not by the numerous failed attempts at sight gags and one - liners . it ' s a true disaster , one that makes me believe that the goofy and unrealistic tone is completely unintentional . despite all this , though , i must reiterate the entertainment value here . you can cherish the awfulness of a film like this . if you embrace the big hit for the catastrophe that it is , you just might enjoy yourself .\",\n",

              " ('note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . be forewarned . the teaser trailers for my best friend \\' s wedding scarsely gave reason for hope - it looked like the sort of goofy , light - hearted comedy than might put julia roberts back in the limelight , but little more ; i \\' d frankly rarely seen a trailer place such an emphasis on people falling over for laughs so often . it was then to both my surprise and my delight to find that my best friend \\' s wedding was such a success - a strong , bouyant romantic - comedy with some decidedly unconventionally quirky comic aspects , featuring a triumphant performance from ms . roberts . the heroine of my best friend \\' s wedding is julianne potter ( julia roberts ) , a successful new york restaurant critic , and we open the film with a whimsical revelation to her editor george downes ( rupert everett ) that years ago , she had made a pact with her dear best friend and ex - lover michael o \\' neal ( dermot mulroney ) , a sports writer , that if they both hadn \\' t married by the time they reached 28 , they had promised to marry each other . both julianne and michael are both single , of course , and when george inquires about michael \\' s age , julianne realizes that he \\' s mere weeks away from his 28th birthday , and is quite distressed when she receives a phone call from michael later that day . however , she finds herself even more distraught when michael \\' s call is in regards to his impending marriage to heiress kimmy wallace ( cameron diaz ) , and when he asks julianne to fly down to chicago for the wedding , julianne suddenly realizes that she loves michael , and resolves to break up the wedding and steal the groom by any means necessary . the setup for my best friend \\' s wedding , then , is a fairly conventional one , and in many ways the film \\' s storyline is formulaic - but only to a certain extent : the film was directed by p . j . hogan , whose first feature , muriel \\' s wedding , had quite an offbeat tone for a traditional uplifting ugly - duckling story , and the same holds true for my best friend \\' s wedding , which confidently combines traditional romantic - comedy elements with a really eccentric sense of humour . the film is innundated with sly mischievousness which seems clearly the influence of mr . hogan . for example , there \\' s a heartfelt , emotional exchange between julianne and michael late in the film - with a trio of teenagers , inhaling helium and sounding every bit like alvin and the chipmunks , harmonizing in the background . my best friend \\' s wedding opens with an inspired opening credit sequence which sets the tone for the film , and there are scenes where actors spontaneously burst into song to good comic effect - it could almost be argued that this film is nearly as much of a musical as woody allen \\' s everyone says i love you ; i \\' d even assert it \\' s a more successful one . my best friend \\' s wedding keeps breaking conventionality with its characters as well . in a typical romantic - comedy , kimmy would be portrayed as a snooty , conniving ice queen , and the audience would be cheering for julianne to rescue michael from her grasps ; this film is smarter than that - here , kimmy is sweet , sincere , and innocent ; julianne even admits at one point that had she not resolved to utterly destroy kimmy \\' s life , she \\' d actually like her too . the george character is almost a staple of recent film - the homosexual male friend of the heroine who acts as a confidant and provides the guiding voice of reason - but in my best friend \\' s wedding , he gets to have a playful , mischievous and charming personality . throughout the film , the formulaisms one often sees is romantic - comedy are given little twists , and the result is a film which is compelling all the way to its somewhat unorthodox conclusion . there is a lot of smart writing in the well - paced screenplay by ronald bass ; we \\' re given four interesting , vivid , and likeable characters , with some good dialogue and some genuinely charming and touching moments . my best friend \\' s wedding marks a strong career rebound for julia roberts , who turns in a top - notch , confident and reassured performance as julianne . this isn \\' t the sort of role one usually associates with ms . roberts - the julianne character \\' s neurotic , fumbling characteristics are more in line with a meg ryan role - but ms . roberts works wonderfully in the film and demonstrates her aptitude at comedy here , remaining compelling and empathetic to the audience , if not entirely sympathetic , even when her deeds done to destroy the wedding plans of her best friend are less than honourable . even better than ms . roberts though is cameron diaz , who turns in a shining performance in my best friend \\' s weddding . with a smile which lights up the screen , she effectively conveys kimmy \\' s insecurity and utter sweetness in an endearing manner , and never hits a false note in the film . she even sings - i won \\' t soon forget her charming serenade of \" i just don \\' t know what to do with myself \" . rupert everett is given a very juicy role as george , and he makes the most of it with a hilarious turn which makes his character perhaps the most vivid and most memorable in the film . his george is a bit of a devilish rogue , entirely affable , and mr . everett \\' s performance is a delight to watch ; he \\' s clearly having fun , and his joy is infectuous . dermot mulroney is adequate in a thankless role - unlike the other characters in the film , he \\' s not given a lot to do , but there is a genuine onscreen chemistry between ms . roberts and mr . mulroney , and consequently the longstanding friendship between his michael character and the julianne character always seemed completely authentic . when julia roberts \\' lustre began to fade , and she was usurped from her title as \" america \\' s sweetheart \" by sandra bullock , i thought it was a canny career move on her part to take supporting roles in prestige projects like michael collins and everyone says i love you to raise her profile . while that didn \\' t quite work out , it \\' s near - certain that her successful return to the genre which made her a big star back in 1990 , the romantic - comedy , will once again raise her ante in the hollywood game . my best friend \\' s wedding marks a return to form for ms . roberts , and cements p . j . hogan \\' s reputation as a skilled director of comedy .',\n",

' okay , it did suck . but you have to show the actors some sympathetic mercy . . . after all , they do pretty well . sinise is sincere and effective in many of his scenes , robbins and nielsen wholeheartedly convince as a loving nasa couple , and funnyman o ' connell - well , he has a couple lines are actually amusing ( and intentionally so ) . the digital effects accompanying the sand tornado sequence are quite impressive . so , by golly , where did this ` mission ' go wrong ? looking back on the appalling experience , i would say in practically every conduit and crevasse it could have . while watching ` mission to mars ' , my suggestion would be to immediately abort , or better yet , don ' t even strap yourself in for lift - off .\",\n",

              " (\"several days after having seen this movie , i ' m still trying to determine what director christopher guest , a man whose sense of humor i usually appreciate , found funny in either the concept or the execution of almost heroes . this is a dreadful motion picture ? a lowbrow example of period piece comedy with terrible production values and an exceptionally poor laughs - to - jokes ratio . there ' s a kind of desperation in the movie ' s approach to humor that reveals the film makers ' uncertainty about how entertaining the material is ; the manic style betrays itself as a last - ditch attempt to hide the flaws of a failed script . the premise doesn ' t sound especially amusing to begin with ? almost heroes tells the tale of two explorers , the effeminate leslie edwards ( matthew perry ) and the uncouth bartholomew hunt ( chris farley ) , who are racing lewis and clark on the trip to the american northwest . edwards and hunt are accompanied by the kinds of weirdoes we find in road movies ( albeit of the early - 19th century variety ) , including a frenchman named guy fontenot who claims to speak hundreds of languages ( none of which prove to be useful ) , a pretty indian maiden who turns into the obligatory love interest , and a bizarre man who suffers a series of debilitating injuries . along the way , the intrepid explorers encounter bears , bald eagles , aging native american warriors , and a conquistador named hildago ( kevin dunn ) who raves about his beautiful hair . the explorers ' trek takes them through forests , across the snow - capped rocky mountains , and over a waterfall . this setup leads to a lot of shouting , a great deal of lunacy , and very few laughs . farley engages in his usual shtick of falling down and bellowing , but , aside from an momentarily diverting confrontation with an eagle , his heart doesn ' t seem to be in it . matthew perry , one of the stars of tv ' s friends ( who had some modest success in the romantic comedy , fools rush in ) is badly miscast . as a foil for farley and an antidote to his runaway energy , perry lacks the necessary edge of the proverbial straight man . i ' m not a big fan of david spade , and i didn ' t like tommy boy , but at least he and farley worked well together . as far as the supporting players go , none of them makes more than a fleeting impression . eugene levy is wasted , and kevin dunn is about as interesting here as he is in godzilla . frankly , it ' s a disappointment to see something this dumb and ugly come from christopher guest , the brilliant comic force behind such films as this is spinal tap , the big picture , and waiting for guffman . although guest gets the costumes right , this nearly - inconsequential success is no substitute for the weak script and unfunny execution . the special effects , such as they are , are execrable . for an example of some really poor blue screen work , look at the scenes where the characters are shooting the rapids ( they ' re obviously getting buckets of water thrown on them ) and where farley is being carried off by an eagle . even though farley didn ' t have the most stellar of acting careers , he doesn ' t deserve the kind of unfortunate epitaph offered by almost heroes . while some of the more outrageous attempts at humor may coax a few guffaws from 12 - year old boys , the level of comedy in almost heroes falls far below the level of sophomoric . farley fans who see this film as a way to say goodbye should be commended for their loyalty , since it takes real stamina to stay seated for the full running length of this cinematic torture session .\",\n",

( note that , in the 1970 \\' s , we really didn \\' t know diddly about the human genome structure , and were hardly in a position to radio out a set of blueprints for human beings . even today , all we can do is give information about dna and how it works , not a copy of human dna , because we don \\' t have it analyzed yet . ) the answers we get from the unknown alien source are plans for recreating a member of the alien race , and doctor xavier finch , played by ben kingsley , is placed in charge of the attempt . the script begins to go off the deep end at this point , when the result is a beautiful young girl who can shape - shift into any of several ugly alien life forms . the first half of the film has something to offer , as \" sil , \" the alien girl , struggles with her multi - form existence , changing from beauty to lizard to giant cockroach and back again , all while trying to understand her own place in the cosmos . she seems oddly knowledgeable about human society , with glaring gaps where her social skills should be . her instincts are to mate and procreate , and some of the best scenes deal with her attempts in this area . escaping from her birth laboratory in utah , sil is pursued by a team of drafted civilians with orders to find her and kill her . she goes on an eating binge , spins herself a cocoon , and emerges as an adult , played by natasha henstridge , who goes a long way toward re - creating the sheerly inhuman beauty julie christie achieved in 1960 . the pursuers : michael madsen is an assassin / exterminator ; forrest whitaker is a convenient empath / psychic , just as though the u . s . government actually had such people on call . neither is able to do much with the writing and directing provided . whitaker \\' s role seems to be aimed at making whitaker a male copy of star trek : the next generation \\' s \" counselor cleavage . \" the other members of the strike team are played by marg helgenberger and alfred molina . kingsley and whitaker are both consummate professionals , too good to not work to the best of their abilities ; but the performances donaldson elicited from the rest of the cast are disappointing and bland , and it is apparent that the direction was a bit weak . h . r . giger \\' s design for the main form of the alien creature is actually a bit boring when we finally get to see it , although previous digital effects were done quite smoothly . the main fault of species is lack of originality ; it starts out with a wonderful , albeit borrowed , premise , and then doesn \\' t live up to it . all we get are chase scenes and a few nice sex scenes , with a few monsters tossed in . there is no buildup of tension and suspense , no climax worthy of the name ; species is just a sequence of \" scare \" scenes stuck together . the movie is carried by its chase and sex scenes , but not rescued by them . on the other hand , as an exercise in sci - fi action / adventure , it certainly beats the ichor out of judge dredd . species earns an extra rating point or two for having ben kingsley and natasha henstridge on board , but by and large , it \\' s fun only for those of us who really like this sort of thing . my personal rating is three stars , but knock one or two of those off if you don \\' t enjoy pretty unclothed ladies and bloodthirsty alien monsters . mpaa classification : r ( violence , gore , nudity , sex , language ) stars : ben kingsley , michael madsen , forest whitaker , alfred molina , marg helgenberger , natasha henstridge directed by : roger donaldson produced by : frank mancuso jr . and dennis feldman typed by : dennis feldman cinematography : andrzej bartkowiak music : christopher young run time : 108 minutes aspect ratio : 2 . 35 : 1 from mgm , opens 7 july 1995',\n",

( in fact , the movie was originally a short film entitled x expanded to feature length . ) the early april release date is too mistimed to capitalize on the movie ' s christmas setting , and the los angeles / las vegas nightlife is something too far from the mainstream for most theater - goers to attach themselves to . the characters are shallow to the point of prerequisite , and performances from little - known players like polley , askew , and taye diggs don ' t help or hurt the roles . in fact , even bigger names like mohr , wolf , and katie holmes don ' t have enough time to make substantial success . although that ' s almost expected for lack of continuous screen time , the success in the picture should come from a thread that binds the stories . go doesn ' t have this , and it suffers because of it . as far as teen movies are concerned , go represents the absolute bottom , for its constant stream of indecipherable light and sound mean nothing without some sort of common theme . ( the following do not count as common themes : drug deals , people attempting to have romantic interludes with drug dealers , people resorting to drug deals for alterior motives , or people not involved in drug deals stumbling into them . ) at times , the humor in go is sickly funny , and on a low night , almost watchable ; but for the majority of its running time and for most viewers , this movie will best be left to teens at blockbuster on a saturday night .\",\n",

intrusive ) bits of fluff passing itself off as a plot . and , as we know , the movie was a smashing success at the box office . mortal kombat : annihilation picks up precisely where that movie left off , with some introductory exposition to clue in those who may not have seen the first movie . shao khan has decided that he \\' s going to take over the earth * anyways * , and to hell with some silly rule about mortals winning the tournament . thereafter follows approximately 85 minutes of film that alternates between being confused , being trite , being silly , and being just plain stupid . one gets the general impression that the producers of the movie thought \" hey , that last movie was such a success that we can get more money and make a * real * movie now . \" too bad they didn \\' t simply stick with the formula from the first movie . i could write volumes about the things that are wrong with this picture , but here are the high points : * the acting is truly bad . sandra hess ( playing the sonya blade character ) is particularly execrable , especially in scenes where she tries to convince us that she loved johnny cage ( a character from the first movie who gets greased at the beginning of this movie ) . * in one of the worst pieces of mis -

awareness . * there are too many characters that are introduced as being potentially important , but then never seen again . * there are a number of completely meaningless story sidetracks , including a muddled scene where liu kang ( robin shou ) seeks out nightwolf ( litefoot ) , has a mystical hallucination , and then wanders off with jade ( irina pantaeva ) . for these reasons ( and many others ) , i can only give the movie a 2 . . . . . . unless you \\' re a huge fan of the games and / or the first movie . in that case , the following critiques also apply : * sandra hess , while being an even worse actress than bridgette wilson ( who played sonya blade in the first movie ) , is much more convincing as a fighter . wilson looked like she was simply mimicing some movements taught to her by the fight choreographer . hess looks like she actually knows some martial arts , and puts together a much more believable fight scene . * in the fights , each of the characters does at least * one * thing they do in the game ( and often more ) . sonya does her \" kiss of death , \" jax does his \" earthquake , \" liu kang does his \" animality , \" and so on . a big bonus for those of us who were looking for similar moves in the first movie and found them only rarely . * there aren \\' t as many fight scenes in this movie as there were in the first , because the folks making the movie mistakenly try to hang a more robust plot in between . silly , silly folks . and the lamest fight involved two of the women in what turns into a mud - wrestling match . lame and so obviously sexist even i ( politically incorrect , for the most part ) noticed and remarked upon it . * the special effects are generally better , except for the final fight scene between the emporer and liu kang in which both perform their \" animalities . \" motaro and sheeva are both more convincing and lifelike than goro was in the first movie . for folks like myself who loved the first movie and enjoy the games , i give this a 5 . you \\' ll probably like it , but not nearly as much as you liked the first one .',\n",

now for the bad news . the entire plot of \" mission to mars \" is based almost wholeheartedly on outdated and preposterous national enquirer type martian civilization tripe . the famed \\' face on mars \\' becomes the centerpiece of the film , revealing some of the most harebrained sci - fi pabulum the screen has witnessed . borrowing ideas from such films as \" robinson crusoe on mars \" ( 1964 ) , quatermass and the pit ( 1967 ) , \" 2001 : a space odyssey \" , and even mario bava \\' s \" planet of the vampires \" ( \\' terrore nello spazio \\' ) ( 1965 ) , \" mission to mars \" is a hodgepodge of ideas that don \\' t add up to a satisfying whole . while some sequences are wonderfully handled and executed , the film remains flat and un - involving . so much time is giving to establishing the lead characters in the film , but to no good use . the performances are all workmen like , with only don cheadle ( as luc ) carrying any sort of real chemistry . gary sinise is wasted in role that requires him to look as if he is experiencing sleep depravation . and the mistaken idea of having jerry o \\' connell ( as phil ohlmyer ) play his part for comic relief is just too painful to excuse . and the less said about tim robbins called in from home performance the better . he \\' s just having too much fun here to give a damn . the script has a few lapses , namely that after discovering several breaches in the hull of the ship caused by a meteorite shower , no one thinks of checking the fuel tanks or the remainder of the ship for damage . this of course leads to our heroes having to abandon their rescue ship . also , when one character sacrifices himself , the character takes on a religious demeanor that is completely at odds with the situation . but the biggest offence in the film is the horrid , intrusive score by ennio morricone . subtlety is non - existent here . in fact in some scenes the music becomes so extravagant that dialogue is almost drowned out . the only sequence in which the score almost works is during the protracted meteorite shower . the pacing of the film is very leisurely . after the opening introduction of the characters ( which lasts a full 22 minutes ) , we are finally dropped onto the martian surface . then , there is another long pause in the plot for more character development , including an elaborate dance sequence in zero gravity . the film could lose about 30 minutes and actually gain some momentum . there are so many scenes of talking heads , discussing what we already know is going to happen , that it drags the film to a dead stop . the good news is that the film is absolutely sumptuous to look at . the vistas of the planet mars are majestic and awe inspiring . the design of the numerous spacecraft and suits are all expertly drafted , with a level of realism that hasn \\' t been seen since \" 2001 : a space odyssey \" . the visual effects are just stunning , from the space walk sequences , to the visualization of evolution on earth . the only fault come with the martians themselves , which look more like something out of a plastic model kit than something from another world . director de palma stages some wonderfully creative scenes through out the film . the opening sequence alone in a seemingly un - interrupted cut lasting almost 15 minutes ( an homage \\' to hitchcock \\' s \" rope \" ) , as we are introduced to all of the characters . scenes in the rescue ship , with its rotating centrifuge , are just amazing in their execution . but the nagging question , is the final explanation worth all of this sturm und drang . sadly it is not . director brian de palma has crafted an extravagant production . the set design and visual effects are all arresting . but it \\' s the comic strip denouncement that ruin what might have been a fine return to good adventurous , thought provoking science fiction . a disappointing film , but one that might still entertain if you can settle for the visuals .',\n",

( presumably there is an exclusive international terrorist club somewhere where the three met . ) the film follows two parallel tracks as the jackal prepares for his $ 70 million hit and mulqueen attempts to locate him while preston makes sure that the irishman doesn \\' t slip away . crossing numerous borders and donning various disguises for both himself and his mini - van , the killer is always one step ahead of his pursuers . being very loosely based on the same book the 1973 thriller \" the day of the jackal \" , comparison between the two films is inevitable . there is no doubt that the original is the better movie , playing the story for suspense rather than the current action / adventure . as a mystery , \" the jackal \" has enough holes in it to ruin the tale , but if you can accept it for what it is , there \\' s entertainment to be had . holes ? let \\' s see ? a pivotal clue for mulqueen is so obscure that he must possess psychic powers to pick it up . for a 20 - year veteran that can command the big bucks , the jackal is an incredibly poor shot . the final scene between gere and willis occurs in a location that should be mobbed with police , but it \\' s just the two of them . willis \\' disguises usually look like bruce willis and are just as interesting as val kilmer \\' s in \" the saint \" . ( and lest you misunderstand , that \\' s not a compliment . ) but the three stars are fun to watch . it \\' s good to see gere in something other than a business suit . willis has a mixed history in picking projects , but his characters are always watchable . poitier is by far the superior actor , but has limited screen time . the problems in logic are flaws , but don \\' t ruin the experience . occasionally there are movies that transcend their blemishes . this is one of them .

( although i wonder if the filmmakers might have extended djimon hounsou \\' s life a bit if they knew this would be released so soon after his acclaim for amistad . ) treat williams is a passable hero , and famke janssen does her best julia roberts impersonation . but while wes studi and anthony heald are particularly slimy , very little of the rest of the company stand out in any way . the biggest treat in the film , however , has to be pantucci , kevin j . o \\' connor \\' s whining engine - boy , under finnegan \\' s employ . his constant quips may be a bit over - written , but they manage to capture the same vein of nerve - addled humor that bill paxton delivered as hudson in aliens ( or todd graff as hippie in the abyss , for that matter ) . it \\' s just a stock part ( the comic - relief character ) , but it almost makes this tired alien clone bearable . as far as the monster goes , although the cgi is done well , the creature has no logical consistency . think back to the great ( or even just good ) movie monsters . they all had a set of \" rules \" about what they could do , and how and why they would do it . part of the joy of those films was slowly discovering , along with the heroes , just what those rules are . the tentacle monster in deep rising doesn \\' t have a set of rules . . . or if it does , not a very good one . it merely eats ( or drinks , as the case may be ) , and there is no rhyme or reason for what it does in order to do so . the film never explains why the argonauticus is attacked in the first place . it simply happens . the action scenes are decent , but few are noteworthy . the film definitely does suffer from its proximity to titanic . deep rising \\' s peril in the water scenes pale next to cameron \\' s ( but can you really blame them ) . unfortunately , deep rising \\' s efforts are more on par with speed 2 . on the plus side , however , the film \\' s closing image shows some promise for a potentially interesting ( but unlikely ) sequel . perhaps you \\' d be better off waiting for that one .',\n",

              " (\"it is always refreshing to see a superstar actor who gets paid more than enough to forget about working for a living to want to take a chance and play a less - than - savoury character as mel gibson does in payback . of course , if i was being paid $ 25 million for one month ' s work , i ' d probably be willing to take risks as well , but that ' s neither here nor there . payback is based on a novel by richard stark ( apparently actually donald e . westlake , author of the grifters , itself a fine crime film ) which was also filmed in the 1960s as point blank starring one of the toughest of tough guys , lee marvin . the film opens with gibson having recovered from being shot several times in the back , by whom we don ' t know yet . all we know is that gibson , as porter , isn ' t a happy chappy and is hellbent on getting the money stolen from him back , and getting even in the process , no matter what the consequences . it turns out that the man he ' s after is val ( gregg henry ) , his sometime partner with whom he stole a briefcase full of cash from a gang of chinese mobsters . obviously not having much of a crisis of the soul , val figures porter is dead and goes about using his share of the money to pay off a debt to his employers . porter , however , is the sort of man who holds a grudge and once on his feet , goes about exacting revenge on the double - crossing val . gibson gives a terrific performance in the sort of role which he was born to play , that of a slightly unhinged guy who doesn ' t mind beating up or shooting people to get what he wants . you probably wouldn ' t see other actors in his salary range take such an offbeat , out - of - character role such as porter ( jim carrey won ' t be doing anything like this in a hurry after what happened the last time he tried - the cable guy , anyone ? ) . harrison ford ' s idea of playing an unsympathetic character is presumed innocent ; the last time schwarzenegger played a villain was batman and robin , which we won ' t mention further ; and has stallone ever really played a villain at all ? this is not to say that porter is a villain , per se . while he isn ' t the sort of character you wouldn ' t want to get on the wrong side of , he ' s nothing compared to some of the ones we are forced to watch in countless bad thrillers and action films where they kill innocent people in the blink of an eye or execute their right - hand men just to prove how mean they are . porter is only trying to get back what is not - so - rightfully his , which in a way is almost understandable . payback is an enjoyable dramatic black comedy - thriller which won ' t be remembered as being among gibson ' s most important work , but is still one of the finer films he ' s done . the only real problem with it is that , while everything seems to work out in the end , i was left feeling something was lacking ; was that all ? the ending looks as if it was tacked on at the last minute , and the final voice - over doesn ' t ring true , even though it was used to good effect elsewhere in the film - noir style the rest of the film embodies . the film just ends far too suddenly , after a huge build - up in the penultimate scenes . a fine film , even though it needs just a little something more to be the kind of a film that can be recommended without hesitation . just be ready for a possible letdown of an ending .\",\n",

and zinnia ( rhea perlman ) , a simple - minded bingo addict . the wormwoods barely notice matilda exists , and when they do , it is only to scold her for spending too much time reading books . when they finally do send her to school , it is to crunchem hall , a bleak place run by cruel , child - hating miss agatha trunchbull ( pam ferris ) . but things begin to look up for matilda when she discovers a sympathetic teacher , miss honey ( embeth davidtz ) , who nurtures her natural inquisitiveness . matilda also discovers another special talent -- the ability to move things with her mind -- which allows her to help herself and miss honey to overcome miss trunchbull \\' s cruelty . it was this spring \\' s james and the giant peach which inspired me to note that the best and most lasting tales for children tended to have more than a hint of darkness to them , and you can bet that the roald dahl responsible for the gleeful ghoulishness of james and willy wonka and the chocolate factory has more of the same in store with matilda . and just as james benefited from the dark sensibilities of henry selick and tim burton , matilda soars on the cock - eyed direction of danny devito . devito made black humor a key element in throw momma from the train and the war of the roses , and he contributes some memorable images . in one scene , an unfortunate girl is made an example of by miss trunchbull when she is picked up by her pig - tails and flung through the air like a throwing hammer ; later , an overweight boy is forced to eat an entire massive cake after he is caught stealing a dessert . matilda is just twisted enough to be a perfect fairy tale . it is also characteristic of the best children \\' s tales that they manage to teach lessons in such a way that children almost don \\' t realize that they are learning them . there is a hilarious moment when matilda \\' s television - addicted father snatches away the book she is reading ( in a wicked joke , he thinks _moby dick_ is pornographic ) and forces her to watch an inane game show ( hosted by jon lovitz ) in which contestants are smeared with adhesive and placed in a booth filled with cash blowing around . matilda is a story which promotes the value of intellectual curiosity over passive entertainment , and it does so while poking holes in that most frustrating of notions for a child -- that because \" i \\' m big and you \\' re little , i \\' m right and you \\' re wrong . \" more specifically , it has as its heroine an intelligent , self - confident girl who struggles successfully against other people \\' s notions of how she should behave . it is no coincidence that matilda was co - written by robin swicord , who contributed the superb recent adaptation of little women . finally , matilda has that quality i find rarest and most treasured in family entertainment : it is family entertainment in the truest sense of the word . devito knows enough to make matilda fast - paced and appealing to children , taking a deliciously nasty performance by pam ferris as miss trunchbull and making it the focal point of some priceless physical comedy , including a great chase through her dark house . the child actors are winning but never obnoxiously adorable , with mara wilson making matilda a clever and extremely likeable character . but there are also many , many delights for adults , including my favorite scene in which matilda uses her powers to frighten miss trunchbull by having chalk write on a chalkboard by itself while matilda \\' s classmates recite in sing - song fashion ; there is also a deadpan cameo by paul reubens as an fbi agent staking out matilda \\' s father . i can \\' t imagine anyone of any age leaving matilda feeling as though his or her intelligence had been insulted . matilda is a film which left me glowing with good feeling . i will see it again , and years from now i will watch it with my children . and now i will stop , because somewhere near you matilda is about to begin , and there is a seat in that theater you should be in , if you have a child or ever were a child .',\n",

              " (\"in 1912 , a ship set sail on her maiden voyage across the atlantic for america . this ship was built to be the largest ship in the world , and she was . she was also build to be one of the most luxurious , and that she was . finally , she was built to be unsinkable and that unfortunately she was not . to get a ticket for this voyage you either : spent a life ' s savings to get to america to start life anew , were part of the upper class and had the money to spare , or finally were lucky enough to have a full house in a poker match by the docks like jack dawson . jack dawson makes the trip , and happens to be at the right place at the right time . rose dewitt bukater , a first class passenger , climbs the railings at the aft of the ship with thoughts of jumping . thus is started a tale of romance and intrigue , and a tale of death and tragedy . . . this movie is about a tragic event that took place a great many years ago , an even that should not be taken lightly as any other bit of historical trivia . the movie titanic shows what happened , maybe not with a 100 % degree of accuracy , but it still shows it very realisticaly . now the titanic is both a story on its own and a backdrop for a story . it serves as both admirably , brining forth an interesting story that although simple in its most simple premise is very captivating . this movie is very emotional simply because of what it is , but that alone is not enough . the story is brought out with a certain style that makes is so much more emotional and so much more effective . movies such as this will not be forgotten all too quickly and unfortunately then are not something that is produced by hollywood with any great frequency . the attention to detail that was paid is remarkable . the whole premise for the telling of the story is interesting , with the showing of brand new footage from the wreck of the titanic adding much flavor to an already good movie . part of the magical chemistry behind this story is the acting , and for this movie its extremely good acting from the whole cast . the performances put in by the main stars is something to be admired . the characters were played out so memorably that both leonardo dicaprip and kate winslet should receive at the least nominations for their roles . looking at the acting done in the movie it seems as if they aren ' t acting but are actually the characters in the movie . the casting for the movie could really have been better , in my humble opinion that is . one character that will most likely not be mentioned by any other review or commentary about this film is that of the ship itself . yes , you read correctly , the ship is a character . how is the titanic a character ? you ask well simple , a ship had a certain character about it and as most sailors and boats men will tell you . this character is everything about the ship from its specifications to its luxuries and the titanic was no stranger to this . mr . cameron brings the ship to life in an almost literal sense . all this adds to the movie in a certain way that most hollywood productions cant seem to grasp . now , to produce the effect that i mentioned above and to sink the ship itself are feats that are accomplished by special effects wizards . the effects in this movie range from marvelous costumes to beautifully rendered scenes of the ships sinking . in some respects you cannot tell that the effects are there , you simply think that what you see is what happened or what is happening ( if your imagination is good ) . the technical wizardry done in this movie is just spectacular and actually getting new footage from the wreck of the titanic is unique . the movie will leave you amazed at the effects , and that is a feat since there is no monsters or aliens in this movie , just humans and an oversized ship . the movie will amaze you and it will pull on your emotions , the theater that i went to had a few people leaving with tears in their eyes . now that is not a feat accomplished by most movies , now the fact that the tragedy actually occurred is brought home with something of a punch , i wont spoil the ending and say what happens regardless it is an interesting movie from beginning to the very end . the historical value of this movie is quite high , and honestly is something that should be watched for the sake of seeing it and seeing the tragedy , for it is extremely well done . the method of telling the story is also good , maybe not totally unique but effective none the less . regardless of anything mentioned above this movie is a grandiose production and the sheer size of the project undertaken is something to be marveled at . the simple fact that the movie is smashingly successful at what it aims to achieve is just astonishing . if you get the chance to see this movie go ! ! ! it might not be the best movie in the world . . but it ranks fairly highly and is well worth the time spent watching it . during none of the 3 hours and 13 minutes of the movie are you bored nor does your attention wane from the movie .\",\n",

wrong . it \\' s all downhill from there as spice world collapses into a series of misfired comedy sketches . i must give the girls credit for their refreshing willingness to make fun of themselves , but writer kim fuller and director bob spiers can barely come up with a funny joke between them , much less a organized framework for all the \" wacky \" goings - on . spice world jumps from vignette to vignette , subplot to subplot with no direction and little sense , at one minute having the girls meet with aliens ( no joke ) and at another having them stage a daring rescue of two young fans who fall into the water during a boat ride . while a decent joke slips through the cracks here and there -- during a \" dance bootcamp \" scene , the girls sing the lyric \" we know how we got this far / strength and courage and a wonderbra \" -- much of the material is not even funny on the chuckle level . some gags are just plain pointless , such as roger moore \\' s recurring role as the mysterious chief , who dispenses cryptic , metaphor - heavy advice to clifford . the only reason why i can think anyone would find that funny is the fact that moore once played james bond . ha ha . as weak as the script is , i think there \\' s one insurmountable problem with even attempting to make a spice girls movie , and that is the girls themselves . the point is not that they can \\' t act ( and , for the record , they really _can \\' t_ ) but that their individual personas , which works as a gimmick over the span of a four - minute music video , are too thin to survive outside of the truncated , video bite mtv world . posh ( who garnered the most enthusiastic cheers during the introductions ) comes off best by default because her persona ( rich bitch ) most easily translates into character in a film . baby \\' s persona ( young innocent ) , to a lesser extent , also works , but the remaining girls \\' identities are a little harder to flesh out . there really isn \\' t much to do with sporty besides having her exercise every so often ( which is _exactly_ what fuller and spiers do ) , and , after all , what exactly entails being \" ginger \" or \" scary \" ? apparently , just their wardrobes . spice world manages to pick up some steam in the late going following a flashback performance of the spices \\' signature hit , \" wannabe . \" the song is as grating as ever , but the energy of the number gives the proceedings a much - needed shot in the arm , setting the stage for a wave of self - referential humor stemmed from the screenwriters \\' film ideas ( the film almost mirrors robert altman \\' s the player in the way the film snails into itself ) . this section of the film , involving all manner of derring - do involving a speeding bus , is perhaps its most effective , but it also points up how all the other storylines ( the publisher , the documentary crew ) lack a satisfactory payoff . spice world is harmless entertainment suitable for the entire family , and it will please the spice faithful . but this sloppy enterprise surely won \\' t win them any new fans , which is what the group sorely needs to bolster its rapidly waning girl power in the states . once the hype disappears , spice world will likely serve as the the spices \\' final hurrah in america .',\n",

( maybe spike \\' s flick wasn \\' t so misguided after all ) . these scenes feel as if they belong in a dopey comedy with feel good aspirations rather than the irritatingly saccharine drama that you \\' ll find yourself trapped in should you not heed my warnings . while the filmmakers have stressed in interviews that they actually hope this is a film that could make the world a better place , to me the final product has the oily feel of a cynical politician contemptuously reciting cookie fortune slogans to a hopeful audience . it \\' s a picture that looks to be tailor made for academy consideration , with the main players ( all previous oscar winners or nominees ) given big emotional scenes that are practically variations on their most lauded turns . one scene in which a slightly de - glamed helen hunt ( de - glamed here means that not only is she a fashion victim [ her look is somewhere between goth queen and trailer park mama ] , hunt \\' s hair is also natty and badly bleached ) verbally castigates spacey , feels right out of her as good as it gets oscar clip . spacey , of course , responds in his cultured monotone , that could be straight from his low key american beauty performance . maybe the actor should get an award for coming off the least self consciously irritating ; though how can he not , even when he \\' s emoting spacey seems somehow shielded by a wry indifference . the usually talented helen hunt is the worst offender . in one atrocious touched by an angel moment hunt slaps osmet , immediately covering her mouth with the guilty hand in that very same stroke , and with said hand still on said mouth , she actually begins convulsing ( dry heaving really ) , then ( and i \\' m not making this up ) she scurries to the kitchen tearing the place apart in a frenzied search for alcohol . the scene is so hokey it could very nearly be construed as a parody of hackneyed tv movie blow - ups ; it \\' s all very theatrical , especially hunt \\' s performance , which feels like a pathetic plea to the academy for another oscar . pay it forward has the dubious distinction of being a film that could be used as an argument for why actors shouldn \\' t get academy awards . the picture unknowingly affirms that oscars transform nuanced talent into overwrought expressionists . even haley joel osemt , the wunderkind who was nominated for an academy award for his unforced performance in sixth sense , seems more divisive about his expressions and inflections . his acting has become broader , less intimate ; it \\' s as if we can make out the little munchkin \\' s thoughts : \" boy this outta floor em \" . naturally osmet is made to play one of those only - in - the - movies children , a martyr - figure who cleans up after his mother , lectures her on the ills of drinking , and even fixes her up on a date with his intellectual teacher . never mind that the two couldn \\' t be more dissimilar ; his mother is trailer trash dopey , and the teacher is one of those dennis miller - ey intellectuals who hides his insecurities behind a vast vocabulary . nevertheless this little nudnik goes out of his way to bring the pair together in a scene that recalls parent trap - ish cornball antics . but oh how we love bright , articulate , self - sacrificing children who pick adults up by their bootstraps and guide them through life . they \\' re so adorable . of course the blame can \\' t all be hoisted onto the actors ( though with the exception of the little kid , they probably should have known better ) , instead the brunt of it should be passed on to mimi leder , who directed one of the most thrilling episodes of er , then went on to make two awful genre films in a row . the first being the peacemaker , a witless post - cold war george clooney vehicle , and deep impact , one of the two films of 1998 to squander the premise of earth \\' s possible demise by a crazed meteorite . the first flick was sunk by an over reliance on clich ? s , and a complete absence of any kind of emotional involvement , not aided by an ending which actually centered around the diffusing of a ticking time bomb complete with digital read out ( apparently present for an invisible audience ) . deep impact has more in common with pay it forward ; it \\' s a movie that treats earth \\' s impending destruction in awfully simplistic terms , completely ignoring the havoc that would so obviously take place if the world believed its planet would be a goner within days . the film was full of inspirational speeches where people really said nothing , though the sappy score swelled up to make it appear as if they were being profoundly touching . in pay it forward leder continues in this vein with her intermittent dollops of cynicism seeming almost like a rebuttal : \" see my movie isn \\' t as na ? ve as you might think \" she seems to be saying . no , it \\' s just horribly confused .',\n",

gebrecht ) and her self - absorbed , eccentric father ( schell ) . her parents are survivors of the holocaust concentration camps , and her home life is filled with angst . her mother is in denial about the past always busying herself by cooking soup and baking cakes and complaining about everything , while her father is more openly loving but has recently been absorbed in searching for two suitcases filled with mementos , a family album , silverware , and his old violin . he buried them in a garden during the war while fleeing the nazis , but can \\' t locate them now due to all the changes in the city . out of frustration after quitting her job as a dishwasher and facing eviction from her apartment , she reluctantly accepts a job as a nanny with an hasidic couple that an old man in her parents \\' apartment building , mr . apfelschnitt ( topol ) , tells her about . the hasidics are ultra - orthodox : they don \\' t go to the cinema or watch tv , adhere to strict dress codes , and strictly observe their religious laws . chaja is at first put off by the way they expect her to follow their rules , but soon finds the wife , mrs . kalman ( rossellini ) , to be kind and she becomes attached to one of her 5 children , a 4 - year - old named simcha ( monty ) who doesn \\' t talk . the stern mr . kalman ( krabb ? ) is not friendly to her and considers her to be a whore because of the way she dresses . to hammer home the point of how anti - semitism hasn \\' t gone away there \\' s a barrage of overdone and uninvolving scenes with a sneering concierge ( bradley ) , who keeps making nasty remarks about jews and tries to make things inconvenient for them by preventing the jewish family from using the elevator . the film is done in by its ham - fisted script as the story , adapted from carl friedman \\' s book \" the shovel and the loom , \" goes from one false note to another until it gets lost in all the goo of its sentimentality . it starts off telling chaja \\' s story of how she \\' s a lost jewess trying to find her identity , then to her nanny role as she loves a mute child stuck in an insulated environment , and then it makes it a story about the lingering effects of the bitter past that can \\' t be forgotten . the effort seemed heavy - handed , as the film kept delivering too many obvious messages that it ponderously kept delivering through the stock characters . the supporting cast consists of all wooden characters who give their roles a cartoonish flavoring : chaja \\' s parents are given no human shades , while the janitor villain was a particularly annoying role that was one - dimensional and falsely acted . the only ones who fought through the script and showed some feelings were fraser , whose effervescent face was expressive of both the trying times she was going through and the joys she felt -- but most admirably showing how she could be so mistaken as to think that she could forget her roots ; while rossellini gave a warm performance of a woman suffering in silence , but is strong in accepting her faith . topol \\' s reassuring performance as the wise man who says all the right things to fraser , acts as the true voice of the filmmaker in explaining all the sufferings with common sense . the film brazenly uses little simcha to get across its agenda of pointing out how the patriarchal world can be cruel when it can \\' t love : it starts out by showing how under chaja \\' s loving care he \\' s taken to the duck pond and soon starts jabbering away , beginning by saying \\' quack , quack \\' and then going on to ask the four questions during a passover seder . but by showing how the boy is so terrified of his strict father that he wets his pants in his presence , refuses to speak because of his stern dad , and eventually becomes the victim of a tragic accident , the film thereby exploits the boy \\' s sufferings and his story just becomes tiresome and not sincerely done . i felt i didn \\' t just see a movie , but i attended a lecture for the whole 100 minutes of this serious but unappetizing story . it was the kind of movie that you hoped would somehow end soon , as it seemed to be in the habit of rehashing its same viewpoint unnecessarily -- the message it keeps sending was already received . in the last shot where father and daughter are hopelessly digging for the lost luggage , one has the impression that no one in the film learned anything about themselves or the past . that seems strange , since i thought that was what this film was supposed to be about . unless i was mistaken and the film \\' s real aim was to make us cry over simcha .',\n",

              " (\"underrated movies are a common reoccurrence in show business today . 1998 ' s ' hope floats ' was extremely underrated and was one of the best movies of the year . we always get films that make big money at the box - office but critics and audiences pan on them . this year ' double jeopardy ' is one of those films . critics are calling it predictable and worthless , audiences are disappointed with it and think it was a disappointment . but as i viewed ' double jeopardy ' i found that it was a great movie , it has a surprising sense of humor and a big dose of heart , along with heart - pounding suspense and twists and turns here and there it certainly is a really good movie . the always wonderful ashley judd plays libby parsons , a woman with a seemingly normal life : a great loving husband , a beautiful son and a great friend . her husband nick parsons has made a surprise for her and is going to buy her the sailboat she has always wanted . after a night of bliss libby wakes up in the middle of the night to find blood all over her and all over the sailboat , her husband is missing and there is a bloody knife on deck . of course being in shock she picks it up and a coast guard comes over and sees her . however she isn ' t immediately ceased until they find out his life insurance was worth two - million dollars and they start to wonder rather she killed him for the money . she pleads not - guilty but is found guilty and sent to prison for six years . while making a phone call to her best friend who adopted her son for her and she hears him say hi to his dad , which makes libby ' s heart stop right there . she realizes she must get out and prove that he isn ' t dead , one of her cell - mates tells her that as long as she has been convicted of a crime she cannot be convicted of it again . which means she can shoot him in the middle of mardi gras and they cannot do anything about it . after she gets out she goes to a halfway house run by parole officer tommy lee jones . he is a man who has had his share of bad things . while out for the day she breaks into a school and tries to track down her kid and husband , leading up to some jaw - dropping twists that are both predictable and not . whatever happens the film was excellent to me . i found the writing well - written as well as the acting was great . ashley judd is such a talented and beautiful actress that she is a hero in a sort in this movie . even if you know what is going to happen in the end , you don ' t know how . this is one of those movies that you really do know what is going to happen , except you don ' t know how they are going to make it happen . it could be one way or another , it could be this way or that way . the movie is highly stylized and extremely well - made . it gets most of it ' s power from the two leads : ashley judd and tommy lee jones both give excellent performances . the characters are well - realized and believable and we feel libby ' s pain when she cannot see her child for 6 years . even though a lot of critics didn ' t like the film , i loved it . the director took his time making the movie , and put a lot of shadowing in the movie . i found it not to be boring at all and it ' s only flaw comes from some predictability . it moved at a fast pace , has suspense , humor , heart and great acting . it earns it ' s right to be a great movie and to me that ' s what it was .\",\n",

              " ('\" first rule of fight club is , don \\' t talk about fight club . \" this quote deals directly with my opinion of this film , because quite frankly , it \\' s not even worth mentioning . director david fincher ( seven ) has completely gone over the edge . with crude humor , an intolerable script and 2 hours and 19 minutes of pure torture , i \\' m surprised i didn \\' t walk out . this just goes to show that hype kills . it \\' s very rare that a film so hyped up as \" fight club \" turns out to be noteworthy , and this is no exception . the story goes like this . edward norton is an insomniac trying to enlighten his dull life by going to a variety of disease therapy sessions , until he meets marla ( helena bonham carter ) . norton claims that she is wrecking his pleasurable lifestyle , when he spots her at a session that he also attended . apparently the disease sessions help them see what life is like , literally living in pain . why any person would think of such a thing is beyond me , but things do get worse . norton is soon assigned to a job that calls for traveling , and it \\' s on a plane that he meets tyler durden ( brad pitt ) . the two men develop a bond , and go out to a bar , and by golly after they get drunk , the two pitiful characters fight . how do they come up with this stuff ? anyway , their fighting catches other pathetic loser \\' s attention , and a club is formed . out of all this mess , there manages to lie a message . fincher shows us that society is like robots . we work in our jobs doing things step by step , and want out . our insanity gets to our brain and makes things worse than they really are , and we blame it on others . call me crazy , but this is common knowledge . i think fincher was acting as if the film is moodier and more poignant than it really is , which is probably one of the reasons it fails miserably . even with two good actors , and a solid actress , they only manage to weaken the story . i couldn \\' t help but hide my face in shame when norton beats himself up into a bloody pulp . it just shows how desperate the script is for attention . i guess brad pitt was right for this role , because i felt like beating him up myself . his bothersome and depressing character , made me disgusted at his 20 million fee . it only showed me that he was in it for the money and nothing more . helena bonham carter however really had no purpose . she just popped up on screen , mumbled some lines , smoked and left . this continues for what seems like 6 hours . the film drags on and my headache gets bigger , while \" fight club \" nears what i think might be the end . unfortunately by then , the film hits rock bottom . though the conclusion kept my interest for a mere 5 minutes , it backs down again and continues to move at a snails pace . on a side note , the trailer shows the only redeeming elements of the film , that coincidentally lasts the same amount of time that they did on the trailer . fincher will hopefully regret making this film or at least learn a lesson . concentrating on the atmosphere or a particular key moment , won \\' t do any good if everything else is in need of support . also , i \\' m afraid that immature men might respond to the film \\' s violence . the last thing the world needs is people praising a leader of a pointless cult . when the film ends , i \\' m just glad to get home and take some advil . you \\' ll either enjoy what the film has to offer , or agree with ed norton when he says \" this is so f * * * ing stupid . \"',\n",

              " (\"i don ' t box with kid gloves . i don ' t play nice , i ' m not a nice guy , and i never , ever , go easy on a film . i consider it to be a breech of some sort of code of ethics for a movie critic . however , i do some favors , and these often come in the form of points that i hand to certain groups due to the artistic bravery . rigormortis , the production company that has been my prime example of how money does not need to motivate filmmaking , gets several of these points each time . i still , however , will not go easy on them . they recently sent me a vhs copy of their down with america trilogy ( which begins , quite wittily , with a disclaimer that they are not trying to undermine america with the making of this film . ) and i decided to spend an hour of my day watching it . in the famous lines of many martyrs , i have no regrets . well , i do have some regrets , but that is not the point in the previous sentence . the point of it was that down with america was a film that , from a critical standpoint , did not entirely disappoint me . sure , the risky use of vhs instead of super 8mm or 16mm was a pain , and the natural light was one of the most annoying things about public access films , but the movie itself was fairly enjoyable . down with america concerns a government agent , needless murder , and a book containing everything from the unabomber ' s manifesto to the 1995 apple computer profit report . like the previous films of rigormortis that i have reviewed , it displays an off - kilter humor and intelligence ? it succeeds in making me laugh where countless studio films fail . the best way to see this film would be as a parody of the countless conspiracy films that we have been drowned in since the paranoia of the 80s . a dying movement from the day they started , these paranoid ` thrillers ' had the government always covering up something and had the same favorite word : ` roswell . ' in down with america , the line ` roswell ' is highly absent . with an about ten minute running time , down with america effortlessly sidesteps every clich ? that the conspiracy films fell into , makes jokes at them at the same time , and provides us with funny and memorable characters . again , i have seen movies that have gone on two hours with characters i couldn ' t care less about . the film , as previously stated , concerns a federal agent ( peter roach ) , an obsessed librarian ( meri stevens ) , a mystery man ( joe kaczkowski ) , and two people obsessed with silence in the library ( robb sherman , kevin flowers ) . the plot : a book containing the secrets of all anarchists is hidden in ? a public library where it can be viewed by all . from there we go into a delightful parody . the federal agent claims his sovereign right to alter the truth , the librarian goes on a diatribe about the sanctity of books . we spend our time laughing at fairly idiotic jokes that are performed much too well considering the lack of coaching of the cast . although the actors and actresses are in small roles and give a whole new meaning to ` no - name ' , it ends up being the no - name people who do a good job , delivering better performances as comic villains than half the crap that hollywood turns out . for once , i don ' t have a url that i know offhand to give you as to where to locate the film online . i can only say that you should find my previous reviews of l ' auto and les x - files and look up the rigormortis productions site in and of itself . it ' s almost as much fun as the film .\",\n",

              " ('let me open this one with a confession : i love cop movies . i adore them with such an unwavering , near foolish passion that i was actually one of the first in line to see 1998 \\' s one tough cop starring the smirkiest of the baldwin brothers , steven . was it any good ? well , just about as good as baldwin \\' s steven seagal impression ( for those i \\' ve confused the answer is a resounding no ! ) . now let me clarify , i don \\' t love just any cop movie ; i \\' m not too keen on the smug buddy cop flicks that were so in vogue in the 80 \\' s and now slowly ( gulp ) returning thanks to jackie chan and chris tucker . i \\' m partial to those gritty , earthy cop dramas like serpico , donnie brasco , and the french connection . problem is these films come along just about as often as george w . bush makes a cogent point so whenever a \" true \" cop movie does hit multiplexes , i come running towards it like an eager puppy ? ? ? and inevitably i leave , head bowed , tripping over my squiggly tail . so what is it about cop movies that transform me into a moron willing to shell out $ 7 . 50 for a movie called one tough cop ( which actually sounds a lot like a wiseguy spin - off , no ? ) ? truth is i \\' m a sucker for those barren streets , that gritty , graffiti strewn modernist jungle where dangerous criminals lurk and cops , like modern day knights , must shield us from their iniquitous clutches . yes it \\' s all very corny and awfully boys clubish , which , i \\' m guessing , is precisely where these feelings come from . as little tots us boys are brought up to create our own wars with gi joe \\' s , enact cops and robbers or cowboy and indian fantasies , etc . the best gritty cop films tap into those gleeful adolescent fantasies , and heighten them , turning it all into an existential nightmare of thin moral lines and psychological chaos . as an adult my tastes haven \\' t changed all that drastically ; sure i can get a cerebral high from the emotional complexities of a krzysztof kieslowski film , but i still delight at the promise a \" guy \" film could potentially bring . now what if it \\' s the cops who \\' re the corrupt ones ? ooh that one really gets me going , these protectors using all that at their service , taking advantage of others for their own gain . throw a courtroom drama ( yech ! ) into the pot and you have the tremendously absorbing sidney lumet film prince of the city . how absorbing is prince of the city , you ask ? so damn absorbing that when the film shifts from gritty undercover cop drama to courtroom drama ( a sub - genre i loath the way kristy swanson must loath sarah michelle gellar ) i remained completely and utterly involved . the film stars treat williams , who gives the kind of performance that should have skyrocketed his career up to the level that brad pitt currently resides at . since i was hatched a mere two years prior to the release of prince of the city , i cannot provide an answer as to why it didn \\' t . ( though judging from his recent roles in tripe like deep rising and dead heat i would guess that it probably has something to do with quite a few bad career moves ) . like mickey rourke and eric roberts ( both of whom are currently doing time in direct to video purgatory ) williams is a talented leading man who didn \\' t make it to where he should have . ( if there was any justice in this dog gone world keanu reeves would be the one banished to direct to video hell ) . here , the actor is given a role not all that dissimilar from al pacino \\' s in serpico ( also directed by lumet ) . williams plays danny ciello , a member of an elite squad of police officers who take down drug dealers on the gritty pre - juliani streets of new york . they work without uniforms or hours much like paid vigilantes . and that analogy is more than apt seeing as how the bunch are kinda sorta forced into using corrupt means to get the job done . the squad relies entirely on informants ( low level junkies ) to gain access to the big wigs , and in order to obtain the info they seek , they sometimes have to provide the junkies with the junk of their choice . danny has done this , and though he \\' s a fairly honorable guy , who took the job in order to do good , his intentions have gotten a bit skewed along the way . he seeks redemption and concludes that the best way to go about getting it is by talking to internal affairs who then convince him to go undercover as a \" double agent \" . he does so with one condition : he will not rat on his partners . right away we know that that is exactly what he \\' ll have to do . and watching the movie build to that is thrilling in the way that any great character driven story can be . undercover cop films are almost innately exciting , even the kind that pull out all the cliches ( like in too deep ) . how can one not be moved by the issues of betrayal , ambiguity , and the danger in putting oneself in such a risky position ? prince of the city takes all this and charges it with a perceptive , hard boiled script and taut unintrusive direction by old pro sidney lumet , as well as a handful of intense performances , most notably by treat . lumet \\' s greatest contribution to the movie is how he lays back , and lets the camera soak up the action . his scenes transition rapidly from one to the next building layers of tension , and he rarely holds for reaction shots , instead he clicks away at precisely the moment a character stops yakking . lumet \\' s worst tendency is one that many film makers ( especially oliver stone ) tend to overuse : he relies a little too heavily on actors shouting their lines at each other presumably in order to ratchet up the tension . this isn \\' t as much a problem here as it was in night falls on manhattan , lumet \\' s most recent cop \\\\ lawyer endeavor , a movie that nearly gave me an ulcer from just watching . though of late lumet has made several really awful career choices ( maybe he and treat should get together for a drink or something ) , the most recent a completely unnecessary remake of gloria , here he was on , sustaining tension in a film that runs for 167 minutes with not one dull spot . some of the formula pictures i like the best are the most simplistic . hollywood often forgets how easy it is to make these kinds of pictures even tolerable . of course cop movies aren \\' t popular anymore ( yes buddy cop flicks are popular but those are more like extended sitcoms with gunfire amid the punch lines ) , but just look at the average hollywood action movies , flicks so bloated and full of unnecessary fat like the boring love interest that serves no purpose other than to stall the action and demonstrate that our hero isn \\' t gay , the lame comic relief character who \\' s never funny , and on and on . for all its moral ambiguities prince of the city is a back to the basics cop \\\\ courtroom drama that leaves out all the crap and really thrills . it focuses completely on its story , and its characters all of whom are completely believable from the cops to the lawyers to the junkies . there \\' s a great scene early on where an irate williams shouts at an ia officer and looks as if he \\' s about to go into one of those corny braveheart inspirational speeches , but instead he breaks down in front of the cop and begins sobbing . this is a scene that would never make it into a michael bay film ( even though bruce willis sacrifices his life at the end of armageddon , not one damn tear ) it would be cut out because the director would say oh that makes him too human , excuse me , weak . in the very next scene danny speaks in a hushed raspiness , straining to get the words out . he \\' s lost his voice . does that little itty bitty detail matter ? maybe not to most , but it sure made my night . and in a sprawling epic of corruption , greed , betrayal and violence it \\' s nice to see that someone is paying attention to the little things .',\n",

what a cast . ok here is the plot in this movie : linda fiorentino plays a regular woman who works at an abortion clinic . one day at her house metatron ( the voice of god ) appears at her house much to her surprise and tells her that she must stop two fallen angels ( matt damon and ben affleck ) from getting back into heaven by ways of a church . ok now get this , she is told to find two prophets : one who talks a lot and one who doesn ' t , however she gets jay and silent bob instead ( who give us great performances ) . now on her way to new jersey with jay and silent bob to try and stop the two angels the 13th apostle falls out of the sky ( chris rock ) and helps guide her to find these angels . salma hayek plays serendipity who also helps her out along her way . azrael ( jason lee ) who is a demon is trying to help the two angels out so that they can win . bethany ( linda fiorentino ) has to now use the help of all these people to try and stop the angels before they cheat their way back to heaven leading to a violent and bloody end that will make you think twice about your faith . what a movie , it is everything rolled into one : an offensive , offbeat , smart and sassy comedy that surprisingly has a great message at the end , and ends up being a feel - good movie . who would have known kevin had such a soft side on him that could make us know that he is a faithful person himself . now for those of you who get offended with this movie really should not take it to heart . yes it may target the catholic community and bash them a lot , but it also seems to rather than go against god and heaven , it actually goes with god and kevin gives a message that there is a god . this review may sound confusing at first but really the only way to understand it is to see this excellent movie . kevin goes to new lengths in this hilarious comedy and gives us some great characters with not too much background or study and rather we start to know the characters as we watch the movie . of course the best ( and funniest ) of them all is the only duo in history that have made me fall out of my chair laughing and that my friends are jay and silent bob . probably the best characters in movies that i like . the star - studded cast is amazing and has some other cameos by george carlin , jeanne garafolo and so may more that we start to lose track after a while . the script was written by kevin smith with many f ' words in there of course and a strong emphasis on sexual talk but he also seems to concentrate on what is important rather that what isn ' t and makes us laugh at the same time as we think . chris rock gives a hilarious performance and gets into his character very well , with some classic lines . linda fiorentino is just perfect for her role and makes us believe that she really is who she is . of course jason mewes and kevin smith do a great job as jay and silent bob with some priceless lines from jay ( as well as silent bob ) . alan rickman , jason lee , salma hayek round out the cast with matt damon and ben affleck in the starring roles . being oscar winners for the classic ' good will hunting ' they give great performances here again but matt damon seems just a little held back and to me did not give it all he could . ben however was all out and got very much into his character as well as the story . the movie ' s only big flaw is that it has a few unfunny lines and some slow parts to go along with it . however the direction by kevin and the script by kevin as well as the priceless performance by many of the cast members , ' dogma ' stands as a new classic and i think i can safely compare it to ' clerks ' . while being funny at times , in the end it becomes a serious movie with an important message that some may not agree with but can ' t deny it . ' dogma ' will offend people , especially deeply religious people , but for those of you who are open minded and want to see some very funny material then this is the movie for you . all kevin smith fans must see ! !\",\n",

              " ('often similar to a little boy lost in a park that he had no right venturing into , the call of the oboe ( o toque do oboe ) is a disappointing film that seems to have wandered astray . many elements of the film are solid , and have potential far greater than director claudio macdowell will ever know , but they simply don \\' t convert into a solid work . although a setting is never established , it becomes apparent . the film takes place somewhere in a latin american village in present day . the community is a dull one , where every day is a downhill slide from the last . over time , the people have taken to themselves . the town cinema is closed , no tourist has passed through in years , and the daily funeral processions are accompanied by no one other than the grave digger . so what happens when a \" tourist \" ( paolo betti ) does arrive one day ? he sends this routine and dull town into mayhem and shock . it is revealed that he is a musician who plays the oboe as a hobby . when he sits down in the park one day to give a solo performance , the entire community gathers around for their first bit of entertainment in countless years . it is from that that the musician meets some of the villagers , and agrees to play at the local cinema in accompaniment to a silent film , thus opening the theatre for the first time in ages . the woman that talks him into this witty task is the cinema owner ( leticia vota ) who also happens to be engaged to the town \\' s police inspector , a figure who soon becomes suspicious of his fiance \\' s involvement with this musician . the rest of the plot closely resembles a freak show gone horribly astray . it features a character who literally rises from his grave , a woman who has a phone conversation with god , and the aforementioned inspector who goes from an intriguing and serious character , to an almost humorous drunk . technically , this film is a nightmare . the music score is poorly edited into the film , so it is often choppy , rough , and abrupt . the lighting is poor at best , which makes it increasingly difficult to focus on many scenes , and the english subtitles are full of misspelled words , and are often absent presumably on the assumption that the audience will be able to understand some simple portuguese and spanish phrases . this translation flaw is best highlighted at the beginning of the film when what seems to be a relevant fight is filled with dialogue , but the subtitles are limited to fewer than 25 words . in addition , the pace of the film seems uneven . it opens with a series of long panoramic shots that alone can test one \\' s patience . the film then moves into a faster pace , that again slows towards the end , as the director seems determined to reach the two hour mark . there was , however , potential for this film . it is a piece exploring the beauty of cinema and music , and the re - unification of people . these are all topics that could easily fill a movie . perhaps , if there were no freak show , and the technical aspects were to improve , there might just be a thing of beauty at the end . most importantly , though , the director would have to patch up the plot and make it flow better so that the two hours aren \\' t such a bore . until then , there seems to be little more hope for this piece , than that boy has by simply crying out \" mommy \" while he wanders astray in a park .',\n",

( my apologies if this sounds cryptic , but there is too much of the plot to give away ) . rounding out the cast are jake busey as angus , dorian ' s overzealous brother and daryl mitchell as roy , dorian ' s trainer at the fast food restaurant . the dialogue is sharp and not filled with sappy overtones , even with the romantic nature of the plot . if there are any complaints , it is over drew barrymore ' s performance . while she does light up the screen , there are moments when she doesn ' t seem all that convincing . the movie was filmed in texas , and most of the characters have southern texan accents . drew barrymore ' s accent tends to come and go ( luke wilson doesn ' t seem to have this problem ) . as well , she seems awfully agile for a woman that is eight months pregnant . still , this movie is one that will please many viewers . with plot twists galore and hilarious dark moments , this is sure to entertain .\",\n",

chicken pies , of course . co - director nick park and his studio , aardman animation , produced three oscar - winning short films : \" creature comforts , \" \" the wrong trousers , \" and \" a close shave . \" the latter two were the second and third installments of a trilogy starring the delightful team wallace & gromit , a man and his dog famous for getting themselves into increasingly peculiar adventures . part of what made the \" wallace \" films brilliantly entertaining was park \\' s uncanny ability to make an old story seem new . \" the wrong trousers , \" for example , pulled out a lot of old hitchcockian suspense tricks , and \" a close shave \" owed a great deal of inspiration to classic detective stories . but in the hands of park and his team , the stories felt fresh and inspired , and not the least bit contrived . now teaming with co - director peter lord , park has created a similar creature in \" chicken run . \" the plot is largely lifted from \" the great escape \" ( watch for a quick reference to the ball - bouncing scene ) , with some spielberg - inspired action sequences providing the excitement . thing is , the film doesn \\' t feel like it \\' s been lifted from somewhere else ; \" chicken run \" feels fresh , alive , like nothing else ever done . part of it is the original idea : who in the world came up with the idea to make a prisoners - of - war movie starring chickens ? park and lord milk the incongruity for all it \\' s worth : the characters treat their situation as if it were dead serious , and to them , it is . but they \\' re * chickens * , so it \\' s funny to us . another thing that helps \" chicken run \" ( and most of park \\' s films ) succeed is the animators \\' subtle way of giving nods to the very films they \\' re cribbing . there are references to \" the great escape , \" obviously , and \" stalag 17 . \" the chase sequence inside the chicken grinder parodies both \" raiders of the lost ark \" and \" indiana jones and the temple of doom . \" there \\' s even a nod to \" the blues brothers , \" if you can believe it , and the filmmakers even get in a little light - hearted ribbing at the expense of their star voice actor , taking a couple of very subtle jabs at mel gibson \\' s nationality and film history . the \" braveheart \" reference is a hoot if you catch it . when you consider just how fine a line resides between a funny parody and a redundant one , \" chicken run \" is downright brilliant in its execution . consider this : since july of last year , i \\' ve seen dozens upon dozens of \" blair witch project \" parodies , on television , on the radio , and online . out of all those , maybe one or two were amusing , the rest tiresome . why ? because once you got past the thought that \" they \\' re parodying that &# 8216 ; blair witch \\' movie , \" most of the parodies had nothing to offer -- no insight , no original idea , no greater purpose . they were only funny if you had seen the movie ; otherwise , you got nothing . conversely , \" chicken run \" doesn \\' t lean on its parodies -- the film references are never the sole focus of any scene . if you \\' ve never seen \" indiana jones , \" the chase sequence is still fun . even if you have no idea who mel gibson is , rocky remains an interesting character . park , lord , and screenwriter karey kirkpatrick realize that an audience does not need a parody shoved in their faces before it \\' s understood , and as a result , \" chicken run \" is filled with visual and verbal jabs that are never too obvious , but not quite vague either . enjoyment of this movie doesn \\' t require knowledge of film history , but if you \\' ve got it , \" chicken run \" is that much richer . the voice cast turns in uniformly lively performances , and the characters they play are given so many subtle nuances that it \\' s hard not to fall in love with every one of them . ginger is perfect , spunky and opinionated , but with a soft heart that forbids her to leave her companions behind , and julia sawalha ( known as the cute mousy girl on \" absolutely fabulous \" ) nails it . she has warm , human chemistry with gibson , whose rocky hides his personal doubt under a brash gung - ho veneer . the characters \\' inevitable romance doesn \\' t feel contrived , but sweet . poor mr . tweedy ( tony haygarth ) suspects the chickens are organizing in some way , but his limited intellect prevents him from figuring things out , and his overbearing wife certainly isn \\' t any help . jane horrocks delivers a lovely voice characterization as tragically optimistic babs ( a hen that runs away with most of the best one - liners , all while perpetually crocheting a sweater ) , and two supply - trading rats that seem to have walked straight out of a monty python sketch nearly steal the show during the lively central swing - dancing sequence . they even come up with an inspired riff on something that \\' s baffled scholars and theologians alike for decades : the chicken vs . egg dilemma . one might have expected this inevitable joke to come off as wearisome , but as with most of \" chicken run , \" it comes as a delightful surprise . the film manages to cross all barriers ; it should be accessible to both children and adults , brits and yanks , rats and chickens . the animation is first - rate . remember that this was all done the old - fashioned way , with actual humans moving clay figurines around on a tiny set bit by painstaking bit , and you see just how truly remarkable \" chicken run \" really is . this movie possesses that same quality that makes pixar studios \\' animation great : precise and unwavering attention to detail . as in such top - notch family fare as \" a bug \\' s life \" or \" toy story 2 , \" \" chicken run \" has something to offer in nearly every frame . certainly a passive viewer can enjoy it as a straightforward story with a worthwhile moral and some surprisingly touching scenes , but a active , attentive viewers will enjoy it even more because they \\' ll catch all the details . anyway , the movie \\' s just a boatload of fun . funnest damn movie i \\' ve seen all year .',\n",

              " ('being the self - proclaimed professional film critic that i am , i am somewhat embarrassed to admit that i had not seen lawrence of arabia ( coming soon to dvd ) until only recently . after all , it \\' s considered by just about everyone to be the masterpiece epic of director david lean , who also directed films such as bridge on the river kwai , and doctor zhivago . so one day , a friend of mine loaned me a copy of the video and i sat down and watched it . i was initially skeptical that something made almost 40 years ago would be able to keep my attention for the butt - numbing 3 1 / 2 hours of its duration . but now i fully understand why this has become the film that other epic films are judged against -- the winner of seven academy awards in 1963 for best picture , director , editing , cinematography , art direction , music , and sound . after watching the film again , i am convinced that it is simply one of the finest works of cinematic genius to ever illuminate the big screen . based on the autobiographical writing of british officer t . e . lawrence during world war i , lawrence of arabia depicts lawrence ( played by then - unknown actor peter o \\' toole ) as a lieutenant lacking any sort of military discipline whatsoever . bored with his assignment of coloring maps for the british army in a dimly lit headquarters building , lawrence jumps at the opportunity to be re - assigned as an observer for an arabian prince fighting against the turkish army . lawrence quickly sees just how caring and great these desert dwelling people can be and ends up rallying the various tribes together to fight the turks and help the british turn the tide of world war i . shot in panavision \\' s famed super 70mm format , the film beautifully illustrates the definition of the word epic . it is absolutely breathtaking . using stunning cinematography , costuming , and direction , shot in the most uninhabitable location on the face of the earth , i can only imagine what it must have been like to sit in a theater in 1962 and watch this story unfold before my eyes . every shot is choreographed as a portrait -- a living tribute to a great land . david lean put his reputation on the line to get this film completed , and the fact that it was even greenlit in the first place says something about the ideology of the motion picture industry at the time , a far cry from its pathetic , uncreative existence today . after watching the film , the first thing that came to my mind was , \" i \\' ve got to do a remake of this film ! \" but then i thought about trying to pitch the idea to a modern - day movie executive : \" okay , it \\' s going to be almost four hours long and shot over three months on location in the sahara desert . we are going to need to blow up a full - size train because computer - generated effects probably wont do it justice . and we are not going to use any big stars , and won \\' t have any female actors since there \\' s no love story . \" yes , my friends , the velvet curtain fell on the golden - era of hollywood a long time ago . but at least we still have the proof to show all would - be producers and directors out there just how good a film can be .',\n",

) . bates relishes her demanding role , and her performance is nothing short of a masterpiece . at times she seems like an innocent victim of her own obsessive behaviour , at times she \\' s a rather tragic character , and more often than not she \\' s just damned scary ! this is basically a very simple tale , but it achieves a large degree of eloquence in its simplicity . it \\' s an involving , engrossing experience - and considering it \\' s basically a two - hander , mainly set in one locale , it \\' s a remarkable piece of cinema . there are no jazzy special effects or cheesy action sequences - this one relies solely upon rob reiner \\' s stylish directing and the wonderful performances of bates and caan . oh , i haven \\' t really mentioned caan yet - he does a good job as the writer who \\' s a prisoner of his own success ( annie is obsessed with him and his books ) . but , as you no doubt gathered from the above - bates is well and truly the star of the show . along with the pig , of course ! anyway , the tension is built - up with masterful aplomb , and some scenes are almost agonisingly tense . there \\' s the dinner scene where seldon goes to nerve - shattering lengths to poison her wine . he succeeds , but . . . she knocks the glass over ! i bet you threw a pillow at the screen as well ! in the immortal words of homer j . simpson - \" d \\' oh ! ! \" other nerve - wracking scenes include the bit where annie has gone off to town and sheldon starts snooping around the house . we cut to annie in her car - she \\' s on her way home . . . he realises this and tries to get back to his room . . . cut to the car again , she \\' s getting near . . . will he make it ? ok , so these sequences aren \\' t exactly original , nor perhaps unpredictable - but they work ! boy , do they work ! if a film has you on the edge of your couch , biting your nails and shouting at the screen in suspense , then it \\' s doing something right ! of course , the most nauseating sequence is the aforementioned \" hobbling \" ! annie realises her captive has been out of his room , and she \\' s going to stop him once and for all . cue a block of wood placed strategically between his ankles and a huge sledgehammer , and . . . i feel ill just thinking about it ! nasty . it all builds up nicely to the final scene where sheldon finally gets the upper hand , and once and for all tries to kill the crazy psycho ! and then we \\' re given one of the most ridiculously over - the - top fight scenes i \\' ve ever seen . she gets hit over the head with a typewriter , set on fire , head smashed against the wall - and she just won \\' t die ! sheldon isn \\' t in terribly good shape either . if it weren \\' t so gorey it would almost be laughable . but it \\' s a terrifically effective film , and therefore the daft climax is easily overlooked . misery is a tight , tense , intense and chillingly entertaining thriller . the directing is first - rate , and the performances - bates in particular - contribute to making this a suitably nightmarish little gem . wonderful stuff . ?

( except there \\' s no red , of course . ) the look is so moody and melodramatic that you \\' ll be shocked when you leave the theater . i saw it at a matinee and took quite a while to adjust to the sunny skies afterward . often the jekyll and hyde archetypes are viewed as splitting a whole person into components of good and evil or perhaps cerebral and emotional parts . here the doctor is intellectual and perhaps good , but certainly powerless . his alter ego is forceful and totally without conscience . two parts that make up a whole . neither are capable of functioning without the other and once separated , disaster is inevitable . the differences between the two characters would be more effective if it were accomplished by demeanor and attitude . when we finally see the transformation , the special effects thrust the story into the realm of science fiction , not the psychological horror that the tale demands . roberts and malkovich are skillful in their roles . both are suitably melancholy , fitting in with the rest of the film . the only flash of life and color comes from glenn close ( and her lips ) as the madam of a whorehouse where hyde lives , and surprisingly , jekyll apparently frequents . life and color maybe , but this is not close \\' s best role . she seems little more than a cardboard cutout character . a beautiful film in its own dreary way . you \\' ll appreciate the filmmaking craft , but don \\' t expect to leave in an upbeat mood .',\n",

( cameron doesn \\' t wimp out like he does in terminator 2 ) the end of the world is the human race \\' s own fault , too . after all it is the humans that created in the evil machines in the first place . back in 1984 , when the cold war was still in full effect , the film must have been seen as a very apt metaphor for nuclear war ( another obsession of cameron \\' s ) . these days , one can read a criticism of machine - like behavior in humans . true , humanizing touches are put into paul winfield \\' s and lance henriksen \\' s detective characters , but the terminator is also able to move through the city undetected . cameron also draw parallels between the mechanical efficiency between the terminator and reese when they first arrive in 1984 la . from a technical standpoint the terminator is very well done . arnold schwarzenegger is a perfect antagonist -- unstoppable , merciless , obdurate . we are not meant to empathize with this ultimate killing machine as we are in some of schwarzenegger \\' s later works ( eg , commando ) , but fear him . cameron and hurd \\' s script basically depicts a one hour and forty - five minute chase , taking a few moments here and there to explain time travel and develop the romantic subplot . while we do see the hackneyed dialogue cameron is now so well known for , there is also considerable suspense especially for the first time viewer who may be unsure of kyle reese \\' s intentions . cameron directs the film at a rapid , kinetic pace . either the camera is moving or something within the frame is moving -- usually both occurs . the violence is not particularly graphic ( temple of doom \\' s heart - pull scene outgrosses the terminator \\' s ) , but it is brutally staged making it that much more effective . for a low budget film , the terminator \\' s special effects and art direction ( especially in 2029 la ) are remarkably well done . special mention should be made of the stop motion effects work at the end of the film depicting the terminator endoskeleton . it is some of the best stop motion i have ever seen . one thing that doesn \\' t hold up after all the years , however , is linda hamilton \\' s hairdo .',\n",

\" i asked . \" why are they churning out stale dialogue with machine - gun rapidity ? \" \" why aren \\' t these characters being developed before their adventures ? \" \" why is there a special effects shot in nearly every frame of the entire film ? \" these were just some of my questions early on . later , i asked , \" where \\' s the magic of the first three films ? \" and \" why am i looking at my watch every fifteen minutes ? \\' by the end of the film , i was tired , maddened , and depressed . george lucas has funneled his own wonderful movies into a pointless , mindless , summer blockbuster . the phantom menace is no star wars film . take away the title and the jedi talk and the force , and you \\' re left with what is easily one of the most vacuous special effects movies of all time . it \\' s an embarrassment . i looked desperately for a scene in which a character is explored , or a new theme is examined , or a special effects shot isn \\' t used . there are a few of each , but they \\' re all token attempts . the fact is , george lucas has created what is simultaneously an abysmally bad excuse for a movie and a pretty good showcase for digital effects . this is not what i wanted to see . i didn \\' t want to leave the phantom menace with a headache and a bitter taste in my mouth , but i did . the story centers mostly around qui - gon jinn ( liam neeson , looking lost and confused ) and his apprentice , obi - wan kenobi ( ewan mcgregor , who scarcely has a line in the film ) and their attempts to liberate the people of the planet naboo . naboo is the victim of a bureaucratic war with the trade federation ; their contact on naboo is queen amidala ( natalie portman ) , the teenage ruler who truly cares for her people . after picking up jar jar binks ( a completely cgi character , voiced by ahmed best ) , they head to tatooine , where they meet young anakin skywalker ( jake lloyd ) and his mother ( pernilla august ) . qui - gon knows that the force is strong with young anakin , and so the jedi knights take the boy with them on their journeys . the bad guys are darth maul and darth sidious , neither of whom have enough lines to register as characters . there isn \\' t anything particularly wrong with this story when looking at it in synopsis form . the way lucas has handled it , however , it unsatisfactory . first of all , we don \\' t learn one single thing about qui - gon jinn . not one thing . what was his life like before this film ? well , i imagine he didn \\' t have one . that \\' s why he feels like a plot device . this probably explains why neeson looks so hopeless in the role , and why he \\' s recently retired from film ( i don \\' t blame him , honestly ) . obi - wan , a character i was really looking forward to learning more about , is even less interesting . mcgregor has just a few lines , so anyone hoping to see the engaging young actor in a great performance is urged to look elsewhere . since these two men are the focus of the phantom menace , lucas has served us a big emotional void as the centerpiece of his movie . things start to pick up when our characters reach tatooine ; young anakin is perhaps the only truly fleshed - out character in the film , and lloyd does a thoughtful job with the role . i was also hugely impressed with the sand speeder scene ; rarely is an action sequence so fast and so exciting . and when anakin says goodbye to his mother , i found it moving . also fairly good is portman , and she manages to give a little depth to a character where no depth has been written . jar jar binks is one of the most annoying characters i \\' ve ever had to endure , but he \\' s more interesting than most of the humans . as soon as the relatively - brief segment on tatooine is over , it \\' s back to the mind - numbing special effects and depthless action scenes . i \\' ve seen many movies that qualify as \" special effects extravaganzas , \" but the phantom menace is the first one i \\' ve seen that had me sick of the special effects fifteen minutes into the movie . the reason is obvious : george lucas has no restraint . i can \\' t say that i didn \\' t find the effects original , because i did -- the final battle between darth maul , obi - wan , and qui - gon is visually exceptional , as is most of the film . but i also found the effects deadening and tiresome . my breaking point was near the end of the picture , as anakin is getting questioned by yoda and the other jedi masters ; in the background , we see hundreds of digital spaceships flying around through a digital sky , and i wanted that to go away . can \\' t we have one stinking scene that isn \\' t bursting at the seems with a special effects shot ? i got so sick of looking at the cgi characters and spaceships and planets and backgrounds that i really just wanted to go outside and look at a physical landscape for a few hours . and then there \\' s the question of magic . what was lost in the sixteen years between the phantom menace and return of the jedi ? i have a feeling that lucas was so focused on how his movie looked that he forgot entirely the way it should feel . john williams \\' familiar score is no help , nor is lucas \\' direction . i think it comes right down to characters : there are none here . i longed for the magnetic presence of han , luke , and leia , but i got no such thing . and what about the ridiculous expectations ? mine weren \\' t that high ; i simply wanted a film that showed me the roots of the films that i grew up loving , a story that had a few characters and a few great special effects . instead , i got two hours and fifteen minutes of a lifeless and imaginative computer graphics show . i don \\' t hate the phantom menace as much as i resent it : i \\' d like to forget that it exists , and yet i can \\' t . it \\' s here to stay . i can only hope that episodes ii and iii have something of substance in them , because if they don \\' t , then lucas will have pulled off the impossible task of destroying his own indestructible series .',\n",

) . i have to say here that i knew exactly what i was getting into going into this film . there \\' s not a frame of promotional footage i have seen for the film that would have led me to believe it was going to be any good . in this respect , the film never disappointed me . this film reaches a level that transcends the \" so bad it \\' s good \" level and borders on the downright insane . the effects are awful , the script is contrived , and for most of the feature i was laughing at things that were supposed to be taken seriously ( i think ) . i challenge anyone to sit through the scene , where a bat stalks a baby in a crib while another bat terrorizes a patron eating at a diner , with a straight face . thankfully , the performances are as good as they can be considering the material the actors had to perform with . dina meyer has always been the highlight of any of the films she has been in ( johnny mnemonic , dragonheart , and starship troopers . . . the latter being the only film out of that batch with any actual merit ) , and this one is no exception . while one never really gets the impression that meyer \\' s character could be a bat expert in reality , one never really cares to doubt it either . she gives as good a performance as could be expected , plus she \\' s nice to look at for an hour and a half . lou diamond phillips is also serviceable here , as the small town sheriff turned eventual hero . although when we first meet his character he knows bats are the reason for what \\' s going on in town , for some reason later on he suddenly becomes amazed to learn that the actual cause of the deaths in town are because of bats . the only bad performance in the film is that of leon \\' s . he is relegated to the \" i \\' m not sticking around here ! \" character and proceeds to repeat variations of that line for the majority of the film even though he stays . anyone who can \\' t immediately tell that bob gunton ( the bad guy in patch adams and countless other films ) is going to eventually turn on the gang and side with his creations before his eminent death will probably be surprised , but i highly doubt it . even if he hadn \\' t been the villain in just about every film he \\' s ever been in , so many obvious hints are given to indicate the devious act that it holds no shock whatsoever . in fact , his death is welcome , because it finally starts moving the plot towards the finale . if the plot doesn \\' t sound ridiculous to you yet , then check out these little tidbits : a multitude of bats inexplicably disperses when a police officer cocks his pistol . an entire town disregards the sheriff and doctor \\' s orders to stay indoors after a curfew is instigated , causing mass hysteria when the bats come out in full force , killing several townsfolk . a government official blows off shelia \\' s instructions ( to wait until dawn to install a cooling unit in the bats \\' cave that will kill all of them off ) by pulling a night job , resulting in the death of an entire military unit . a cavern full of bat feces never ignites when a phosphorus flare is lit right in the middle of it . finally , to top it all off , this little texas town is showing nosferatu in it \\' s single screen theater ( for reference , our town has over a million people in it with nearly 150 movie screens , and we \\' re lucky to even get kevin smith \\' s dogma ) . the most laughable part of the movie though comes from the ill - conceived bat puppets . while the actual bat attack scenes are shot with rapid fire editing ( making the scenes nearly impossible to comprehend what \\' s going on ) , the scenes where a bat is called upon to interact with a live actor are usually shot more low - key . therefore we the audience get loving close - ups of the most unrealistic , rubbery bat puppets ever committed to film . being able to see the puppeteer \\' s arms would be the only things that could have made these creations worse . after all of this , if you still decide bats might be the movie for you , don \\' t say you haven \\' t been warned . trust me when i say that it \\' s a lot more fun to trash than it is to sit through . i just wish that dina meyer would be cast in more roles or at least choose better films to appear in . she \\' s definitely a talent that is going to waste in films like these .',\n",

not even the tv series got that stupid ( at least not on the grand scale of stupidity that \" batman & robin \" showcases ) . frustrating too are the various supporting characters that walk on and off with nothing to say or do . blink , and you \\' ll miss elle macpherson as julie madison , vivica fox as a \" why is she even in the film \" vamp in freeze \\' s lair ( with all of two lines ) , and pat hingle as the most ineffectual commissioner gordan the batman series ever had . and in what almost seems like an effort to save on costs , vendela kirsebom has no lines as mrs . fries -- she isn \\' t even filmed well enough to look good ( trust me , she \\' s quite attractive outside of this dreck ) . and as if the film weren \\' t bad enough to limp along with bad direction , bad dialogue , bad performances , and bad fight scenes , there are inconsistencies and illogic galore . i know it \\' s nit - picky to ask where the hundreds of feet of cable are stored in the batarangs , why the character \\' s arms aren \\' t ripped out of their sockets when they accomplish a one - armed batarang save after falling hundreds of feet ( while holding on to another person no less ) , or where the moisture comes from when freeze \\' s weapon creates tons if ice . that \\' s all traditional comic book stuff . but why does batman spring a trap for freeze at a public charity event that endanger the lives of hundreds of by - standers ? why is there a big switch clearly marked , \" heat \" in mr . freeze \\' s lair ? why do countless bumbling police officers even try to take on mr . freeze hand to hand ? why does alfred encourage silverstone to become batgirl and even go so far as to have a suit made for her ? why do batman & robin take 10 minutes to bicker before leaving the batcave in response to an emergency ? and since it established early on that ivy is using pheromones , why don \\' t they wear masks to filter it out ? i could go on and on . \" batman & robin \" is a braindead , pointless , garish , loud film that should still reign as the \" worst film of the year \" by the time 1998 rolls along . note to warner bros . -- if you \\' re going to make another batman film , please replace schumacher with nearly anyone . because it could actually get worse than this . what schumacher does not understand is that \" comic book \" doesn \\' t automatically equal unbearable idiocy . the true equation seems to be schumacher + batman = unbearable idiocy .',\n",

              " ('the promotion for fear and loathing in las vegas ? has made the film out to be a comedy , and for about the first hour or so it seems like it might be one . it \\' s 1971 , and the hippie movement has left behind quite a few wash - outs , among them journalist raoul duke ( johnny depp ) and his \" attorney \" dr . gonzo ( benito del toro ) . these two spend most of the film in a drug - induced stupor , having strange hallucinations , trashing their hotel rooms , and either annoying or scaring almost everyone that crosses their path . duke is first assigned to cover an outdoor desert motorcycle race in las vegas , but gets lost in a blur of drugs , beer , and flying dust , and ends up wandering around with no clue who won . he leaves vegas briefly before he is sent back , in what can only be described as a strangely appropriate twist of fate , to cover a drug enforcement conference . fear and loathing has been misinterpreted by some as glorifying the use of drugs . it doesn \\' t , even in the beginning -- while the pair \\' s antics are sometimes amusing and relatively harmless at first , the humor here is still fairly dark . director terry gilliam views them with a rather satirical eye , and even when we \\' re laughing , we \\' re laughing at them rather than with them . they spend most of their time paranoid , angry , or just plain befuddled , which is probably an understandable reaction to seeing the entire room suddenly fill up with giant reptiles . the black comedy may be entertaining to watch onscreen , but it \\' s probably not something most other audience members would want to experience first - hand . all this aside , i was starting to grow a bit restless as the film drew near its one - hour mark , thinking to myself that i wanted something more out of this than just an off - kilter satire of drug culture . thankfully , the script delivers it before too long , as duke , in a rare moment of lucidity , stops to recall how he was once an enthusiastic hippie , \" riding the wave \" of something that seemed special and important . now it \\' s six years later and the wave has finally broken , as he puts it . materialistic culture is still alive and well and , for most of this film , right in his face in las vegas ; the \" american dream \" of which duke occasionally speaks is still just as shallow and phony as ever . the social protesters have lost , and the more questionable aspects of the movement have turned ugly and left casualties such as duke to drift in a sea of drugs and disillusionment . in many ways , fear and loathing is gilliam \\' s most reality - based film ; all of his others , with the exception of the fisher king , have made use of some sort of fantasy or science - fiction plot elements . yet it is his off - the - wall masterpiece brazil ? to which this film bears the most visual resemblance . the protagonist of brazil found himself alternately surrounded by a plastic , soulless society and the constant chaos of totalitarian police inspections and terrorist attacks , and similarly duke \\' s world is composed of the artificial , empty glam of las vegas and the bizarre anarchy of his drug hallucinations . unlike the protagonist of brazil , however , duke is not a particularly admirable figure , and neither is gonzo . during the latter half of the film , their trips turn nastier and the consequences worse , eventually building up to an incident an a diner in which gonzo crudely frightens and humiliates a waitress , while duke , though he doesn \\' t seem to approve , doesn \\' t do anything to stop it either . by the time this scene takes place , they don \\' t seem like hippies or peaceniks or protesters or anything of the sort any more ; they just seem like a couple of stoned jerks in a diner . duke seems to realize at some level that he \\' s become something he doesn \\' t like , but he \\' s either too apathetic or too defeated to do anything to change . this film has taken a critical drubbing from many who view it as an essentially pointless film that simply throws one trip scene after another at the audience . while gilliam may have overdone it in a few places , i think he and his co - writers deserve more credit than that . there \\' s plenty of substance here , particularly in the second half ; its observations about the broken and defeated rebels from the \\' 60s and the objects of their rebellion just aren \\' t usually very pleasant . unlike , say , brazil ? or the fisher king , both of which feature a character who dares to let himself dream in a repressive environment , fear and loathing in las vegas ? shows us someone who \\' s given up on his dreams and resorts to the quick fix of drugs . in its own psychedelic , whacked - out way , it \\' s sad and regretful , but i think it \\' s also a bit of a kick in the pants , a challenge to find an alternative between chemically - induced withdrawal and the equally addictive drug of vegas - style materialism . indeed , duke himself admits at one point that he \\' s never learned to accept that you can get higher without drugs than with them . i \\' m not sure if he \\' s any closer to accepting it by the end or not , but i suspect the audience will get the idea .',\n",

s in this film that it is almost painful to watch . luc gets saddled with the task of saving erin the reporter early on , and in the course of a single night , they go from bickering to falling for each other , to kissing . erin is a pathetically - written character ; people are getting brutally gunned down all around her , and yet , not only does this not seem to frighten her , but she finds time to remind luc that she \" isn \\' t leaving without her story \" . whatever . other laughable moments include a ) luc going to a strip club to get internet access ( what ? ) and b ) a group of rangers , who after having been given good advice ( luc tells them that their weapons are useless , and shows them a specific gun which should work better ) , choose to go into battle with their useless weapons anyway ( guess who wins the battle ? ) . not one single scene in universal soldier : the return has any originality to it . when fuelled by don davis \\' loud , driving music score , the film \\' s many fights become almost passable , but mostly are full of the same ol \\' jean - claude moves . director mic rodgers ( a former stunt co - ordinator ) keeps the action coming at a rapid pace , with only a few token serious moments to be found . his past work is evident in the many moments when characters are thrown through windows , tossed off of buildings or sent flying through the air thanks to an explosion . if only jean - claude weren \\' t getting so old and slow compared to younger martial arts film actors like jet li , rodgers could probably have made a decent action film . to place the blame squarely at van damme \\' s feet , however , is an injustice . i \\' m not sure that anyone , not even robert deniro or edward norton , could make writers william malone and john fasano \\' s script sound good . one particularly painful scene is when erin asks luc how he is so sure that the aforementioned strip club will have internet access . he cringes , looks down and mutters \" uh . . . uhm . . . they all do , i saw it on 60 minutes . eh he he he \" the script \\' s and indeed the entire film \\' s only saving grace is goldberg . he chews up every scene he is in , obviously enjoying his role immensely . he even gives the film a few laughs , as he mutters things like \" i really don \\' t like that guy \" every time he fails to kill luc . sadly , his presence is not enough to turn universal soldier : the return into anything better than a below - average action film that truly deserves to have joined its fellow sequels by going straight - to - video .',\n",

) . just when all seems lost , though , gurgi reappears , and rescues taran , eilonwy , and fflewdurr . taran is about to jump into the black cauldron , but gurgi stops him , not wanting him to throw his life away . gurgi then jumps into the black cauldron , and the deathless warriors decay . taran tries to find a way to rescue gurgi , but he is forced to do battle against the horned king . he kicks the horned king away , who is then magically sucked into the black cauldron , where its powers immediately destroy him completely . taran , eilonwy , and fflewdurr manage to escape from the horned king \\' s castle just as it self - destructs . the witches then reappear and attempt to take the now useless black cauldron away , but fflewdurr stops them , saying that they ` never give anything away , they bargain \\' . in response to this , the witches offer taran his sword back , but taran instead has a new trade : the cauldron for gurgi . the trade is made ; gurgi \\' s seemingly lifeless body reappears before the heartbroken group . as taran cradles him in his arms , though , gurgi stirs - he is not dead after all ! the happy group then returns home , where hen wen ( brought home by the fairfolk once the dangers are past ) , dallben , and even doli , await their triumphant return . as spectacular as it sounds , the black cauldron really suffered a lot in its past times . before ron miller was fired from his position as chairman of walt disney productions , he had bought a novel by lloyd alexander called the black cauldron , a sword and sorcery tale for the studio . bringing this book to the screen was the studio \\' s fondest dream . miller , who entitled himself as the executive producer , promised that they would do so after they had proved themselves on other projects . when micheal eisner and his executives arrived at the disney animation studio , the animators were struggling to complete the black cauldron . by this time , things had gone really rocky for the animation department . many of the studio \\' s old men had retired or died . therefore , the animators suffered a hard time making this film . originally budgeted at $ 25 million , the costs raised to $ 40 million because of constant changes on everything ? and when it was finally released on june 24 , 1985 , the black cauldron was greeted by praising reviews from some critics , but somehow the film flopped . the film was rated pg and the film , although ` disneyfied \\' from lloyd alexander \\' s chronicles of prydain ( which is what this film is based on ) , was much more scarier and darker than disney \\' s other previous efforts , such as the rescuers and the fox and the hound , which is probably why so many people considered it too scary and stayed away from it . in addition , other critics rejected it for having ` no heart \\' and ` unmemorable \\' , compared to other disney animated features . but whatever the real reason , the black cauldron was a financial disaster , grossing only $ 21 million . the failure of the film grounded the studio \\' s animation department , and exiled the animation team to annex buildings in nearby glendale , and it seemed like animated features would no longer become a part of the studio \\' s reputation . the next two disney animated features , the great mouse detective and oliver and company , although a little more lighthearted than the black cauldron , didn \\' t do much better ( although oliver and company grossed much more than the black cauldron and the great mouse detective ) . only with the little mermaid did the studio regain its reputation for successful animated features . as for the black cauldron , it was rereleased in some cities for a temporary time under the title taran and the magic cauldron . finally , the studio locked the film in the film vault and denied that it ever even was released . because of all this , you might ask yourself , was the black cauldron really such a bad movie ? the people who had seen the film didn \\' t think so . in fact , many people had calls to buena vista home video requesting for the film , but of course , they denied it . for a while , it seemed like the black cauldron would never be released to video ? until september 1997 , disney released the black cauldron to video in the united kingdom . few people imported the video from england and converted to ntsc ( including me ) and for those who hadn \\' t seen the film yet ( i am included here ) , they got quite a treat . but people who had bootleg copies of the black cauldron noticed that in the scene where the horned king raises his army of deathless warriors , about 12 seconds of ghoulish looking skeletons were slightly trimmed so that the film would get a u rating ( in the uk , the u rating means universal : suitable for all ages , kinda like their own version of g ) . somewhere online , a team of diehard the black cauldron fans signed a petition that said , ` bring back the black cauldron ! \\' , and because of that , disney finally decided to release the video to the united states . before that time , rumors online had been made that the video would be trimmed , like the uk video , so that it would get a g rating , and that they would add in songs . those rumors were put to rest when the walt disney company announced that the black cauldron * would * be released in its pg rated version . even still , when it was finally released to the us , some reaction was mixed . some felt that it was indeed cut , but some felt that it wasn \\' t . but these where only minor criticisms which seemed laughable , since a film that was absent for thirteen years was finally available . as for myself , when i saw the movie for the first time ( on converted ntsc video ) , i didn \\' t expect much at all . in fact , i had heard so many mediocre things about it , that i didn \\' t think the film would ever be such a good film . much to my surprise , when i saw the first few minutes of the film , i was asking myself , \" this is the same film everyone saw ? the one that flopped at the box office ? the one that critics and filmgoers alike called \" a bad movie \" ? this doesn \\' t seem like all of the above . instead , it \\' s a classic in its own right . the film has a wonderful cast of characters . there \\' s taran ( grant bardsley ) , an assistant pig keeper who would rather be a warrior than a pig - keeper , the story \\' s hero . the critics have said that taran is not likeable at all , but the opposite is true . he is brave , loyal , and eventually learns a lesson about friendship later on . there \\' s a likeable character here ! not that he \\' s the only likeable character in the film . there \\' s gurgi ( john biner ) , a lovable little , uh , thing who remains loyal to taran , even though they don \\' t quite hit it off at first . but another likeable character is the bad guy comic henchman , a dwarf named creeper ( phil fondacairo ) , who is loyal to the film \\' s imaginative and sinister villain , the horned king ( voiced gruesomely by john hurt ) , yet he also fears his neck . the other characters , including the sidekicks , a spunky , but sweet princess named eilonwy and the comic bard fflewdurr flamm , and three comically wicked witches who hide a dark secret , although pleasant and likeable , aren \\' t quite as well rounded as they should be . the story itself is an adventurous one , a quest involving the mystical pig , hen wen , the black cauldron itself , and an army of deathless ones with everything : a hooking opening to a spectacular finale . elmer bernstein \\' s music also tells the story perfectly , in a dark , yet calming manner . the animation itself is surprisingly good considering that this film was created in the darkest time of the studios . even though there are some occasional effects that are not quite good , like the ground opening when the black cauldron rises out of the earth , the animation overall is top notch . overall ? this film is an entertaining endeavor . fans unfamiliar to the lloyd alexander chronicles of prydain will get a kick out of this one , except young kids . there are some extremely scary scenes which are more darker than disney \\' s other films ( although some consider the stampede sequence from the lion king and frollo observing esmeralda in the fires of hell in the hunchback of notre dame are just as scary ) , which is the main reason why this film is rated pg . fans familiar to the lloyd alexander series will recognize the differences between the novel and the movie . even though it doesn \\' t have all of the ingredients of a true disney film , this film is a classic in its own right , and deserves a far better chance than what it has been given . that better chance has finally come . whatever reason about why the black cauldron was such a big failure seems to have disappeared , and the film has finally achieved its place among disney \\' s most proudest achievements . i can \\' t help but think though , whatever would have happened if the black cauldron * was * a box office success ?',\n",

              " (\"the release of dolores claiborne into wide release this weekend adds another entry into the long list of film adaptations of stephen king ' s work . this slow - moving character study provides some outstanding acting performances by the principals , but suffers from a tepid conclusion , inconsistent direction , and may not have wide commercial appeal . when the maid , dolores claiborne , is found brandishing a rolling pin standing over the bloody and dead body of her employer , it seems like an open - and - shut murder case . upon hearing of the death via a mysterious fax , dolores ' estranged and bitter daughter , esquire magazine writer selena st . george , returns from new york back to her tiny island village childhood home . as the two clash horns , the story behind the mysterious death of dolores ' abusive husband two decades ago , ruled an accident despite the protests of detective john mackey , is revealed . did dolores kill her husband ? and did she kill her employer ? dolores claiborne is certainly more of a character study than a suspense thriller . consequently , it is fortunate that their cast includes some of hollywood ' s finest character actors , such as bates , leigh and strathairn . kathy bates plays the film ' s title character , and gives a sensational lead performance . dolores claiborne is essentially a showcase for the talent of bates , as her character has a huge amount of screen time . she dominates the screen , producing a character that is compelling and arresting , as we watch the character go through two decades of history via flashbacks . kathy bates ' performance is award - calibre stuff . the rest of the cast is also very good . jennifer jason leigh plays the perpetually sour , bitter helena st . george well , and christopher plummer seems to be enjoying himself as dolores ' ever - present nemesis , the determined detective john mackey . david strathairn is particularly interesting and suitably smarmy and despicable as dolores ' husband , joe st . george . judy parfitt is fine as dolores ' tyrannic socialite employer , vera donovan -- it would have been interesting to see , say , meg foster in this role . child actor ellen muth is also worth noting as the young selena during the flashback sequences ; she is very impressive . the direction of dolores claiborne by taylor hackford wildly varies throughout the film , ranging from some parts which are quite clever in their own right , to parts which are embarrassingly hokey . the segues between flashbacks and the present are very hit - and - miss in terms of effectiveness . the pacing of the film tends to be numbingly slow , which tends to undermine any suspense which might be built up . however , the cinematography by gabriel beristain is wonderful -- i particularly like the chilling ice - blue hue permeating the present - day scenes , contrasting well with the many nova scotia ocean shots -- and danny elfman provides a surprisingly understated score for the film . it would seem that the commercial potential of dolores claiborne is limited . none of the performers in the film could be classified as a big draw , and its pacing may be a turn - off to those expecting a gripping suspense film filled with twists and turns and car crashes and axe - wielding psychopaths . although being essentially the only film in its genre in release now , it may also be hurt by the negative perception of king works , even with the recent critical success of the shawshank redemption and the stand . dolores claiborne suffers from a very unsatisfying conclusion , and moves very slowly . however , the performances are uniformly excellent , particularly kathy bates , and the film has its moments . on my four - star scale , i give dolores claiborne three stars .\",\n",

( my personal favorite is a patrick swayze movie called steel dawn , which was fairly well made on a small budget . ) now we have waterworld , which again brings the traditional lone gunman to town to rescue the young widow and her daughter .

              " ('cinematically speaking , gordon parks \\' original 1971 _shaft_ is not a great film . a bit slow at times and more than a little rough around the edges as it builds to its climactic explosion of violent action , this spirited but formulaic yarn that initially brought ernest tidyman \\' s \" black private dick that \\' s a sex machine to all the chicks \" to the big screen hardly qualifies as groundbreaking filmmaking . yet nearly 30 years after its original release -- and long after the genre it spawned , \" blaxploitation , \" died with that decade -- the 1971 _shaft_ remains an extremely entertaining watch , never having completely escaped pop culture consciousness . the reason for this is the same one that explains the film \\' s connection with moviegoers far beyond the target african - american audience : the title character of john shaft . while the fact that the strong , smart , virile , and superbly suave shaft is black is the primary factor for his historical and cultural significance , his broad - based appeal stems from an idea that transcends race : he is comfortable , confident , and proud about who he is , and anyone who had a problem with that could simply kiss his ass . this fact also explains why john singleton \\' s y2g revival of john shaft is as enjoyable as it is . much like the film that started the franchise , this _shaft_ \\' s plot doesn \\' t score points in the originality department , but the energy level and smooth attitude distinguishes it from standard crime thrillers . contrary to what has been reported over the past few months , this _shaft_ is not a remake of the original film , but more of a sequel / spinoff . the star audiences know and love from the original film and its first two sequels ( 1972 \\' s _shaft \\' s_big_score ! _ and 1973 \\' s _shaft_in_africa_ ) , richard roundtree , once again plays john shaft , who still runs a private investigation firm in new york city . however , the focus of the film lies on his same - named nephew ( samuel l . jackson ) , who , as the film begins , is a cop whose take - no - crap demeanor constantly leaves him at odds with his superiors . when a privileged young man named walter wade jr . ( christian bale ) accused of a brutal , racially - motivated murder is allowed to be released on bail , a disgusted shaft leaves the force and decides to take matters into his own hands as a p . i . but that \\' s easier said than done , for also standing in the way of shaft and his way of justice is peoples hernandez ( jeffrey wright ) , a dominican gangster who is hired by walter to rub out waitress diane palmieri ( toni collette ) , the only eyewitness to his crime . peoples -- or , rather , wright is also the big obstacle in jackson \\' s way toward commanding this film . peoples is more of an outrageous comic character for most of the running time , and wright is insanely funny during these stages . however , he isn \\' t so funny as to make the character come off as goofy and buffoonish , and peoples \\' eventual turn to more serious villainy is seamless and believable ( which probably would not have been the case had he been played by original casting choice john leguizamo , who bowed out before filming ) . it \\' s no easy task to steal a film from the jackson ( who is his usual captivating , charismatic self here ) , but that \\' s exactly what wright does -- and makes it seem effortless . then again , with such a talented ensemble surrounding him , it is not too surprising that jackson \\' s impressive star turn doesn \\' t quite tower over the rest ; he is strongly complemented not only by wright but all his other co - stars . bale has already proven his ability to play an uppity killer in _american_psycho_ , so it only follows that his performance as a similar , less exaggerated character would be spot - on . collette lends the film some convincing and welcome dramatic weight as the frightened , conflicted diane . busta rhymes brings some good laughs as shaft \\' s sidekick rasaan . registering not as strongly -- but through no fault of their own -- are vanessa williams ( as tough narcotics cop carmen vasquez ) and a dismayingly underused roundtree ; they simply are given little to do in the script credited to richard price , singleton , and shane salerno . ( jackson also has little to \" do \" in a sense ; some throwaway footage during the opening credits aside , his shaft doesn \\' t even have one sex scene . ) that singleton once again proves his ability with actors is an especially good thing since he \\' s not really an action director . this is not to say that he does a bad job with the numerous gunfights and the requisite foot and car chases . they move well ( as does the film as a whole ) and are reasonably exciting ; it \\' s just that there \\' s nothing terribly inventive about them . these set pieces are functional in the way the script is : they work well enough , but they \\' re unsurprising and conventional . but if there \\' s anything that a _shaft_ movie does well , it \\' s make the familiar look cool -- and this _shaft_ keeps that tradition alive . from the slick title sequence -- scored , of course , to isaac hayes \\' ever - infectious oscar - winning theme song , which singleton wisely sprinkles throughout the film -- on , the film looks great and easily sweeps the viewer into its world with its energetic bravado . even a common visual trick such as employing fancy wipes for scene transitions not only feels unforced , it feels necessary . style doesn \\' t exactly make for a great film , but when it comes to _shaft_ , that \\' s of little consequence . what matters above all else is having a good time , and the latest _shaft_ should be just the first of many fun rides to be had with this bad mutha -- shut your mouth .',\n",

              " ('if anything , \" stigmata \" should be taken as a warning against releasing similarly - themed films relatively close to one another . of the four supernatural horror flicks released this year , it is clearly the worst . i suppose i should have seen this coming . after all , \" blair witch \" thoroughly creeped me out , \" sixth sense \" was mildly spooky , and then \" stir of echoes \" had its moments , but wasn \\' t anything i \\' d lose sleep over . clearly , the quality of the horror this summer has slowly been dropping . is it then any surprise that \" stigmata \" is the dullest , most horribly executed piece of mtv - influenced tripe i have seen in a long while ? no , not really . patricia arquette plays frankie page , a hairdresser from pittsburgh who receives a rosary as a gift from her globe - trotting mother . as it turns out , the rosary belonged to a recently - deceased brazilian priest . the priest \\' s church had been under investigation by father andrew kiernan ( gabriel byrne ) because of the mysterious appearance of a bleeding statue . father kiernan is an investigator who has made a career out of disproving supposed religious signs , but this time he believes there is something to the bleeding statue . his investigation is soon called off , however , when the frankie starts exhibiting signs of the stigmata , in which a person is inflicted with wounds like that of jesus christ . father kiernan is initially skeptical of frankie \\' s story , considering she \\' s an atheist , but once he witnesses the stigmata attacks himself , he dedicates himself to finding out what is going on . he eventually begins to suspect that his boss , cardinal houseman ( jonathan pryce ) , is concealing something that could bring down the catholic church . as it turns out , the dead priest had been working on the translation of a \" fifth gospel \" before they were excommunicated . the new rupert wainwright music video . . . i mean film \" stigmata \" is the sort of film that starts off ok and only gets worse . indeed , it would have been good if it were a music video , because it \\' s only interesting for about five minutes . i \\' m not sure what wainwright is trying to prove with his endless parade of slow - motion , double - exposure , and extreme close - ups ( whoaaaaaa ! ! ! ! ) , other than the fact that he has the most swelled head of any director in hollywood and , yes , he has been to film school . his camera trickery is interesting for a little while , but eventually , it becomes headache - inducing . what this film needed is a second audio track to be played over the dialogue ( such as it is ) , with wainwright screaming at the audience , \" see ? look at what i can do ! i \\' m an ex - cellent dir - ect - or . \" maybe then he \\' d explain why he decided to start half of his scenes with slow - motion shots of water dripping in reverse , or why he included random superfluous shots as that of an egg frying ( ooh , scary ! ) . if there was some underlying meaning behind all this camera trickery , i didn \\' t see it . just when you thought it was safe to get involved in the story , here comes a double - exposure shot of two patricia arquettes collapsing into bed for no reason whatsoever . arrrrrrrghhhh . . . then again , the superfluous camera trickery wouldn \\' t bother me if \" stigmata \" had a story or characters that were remotely engaging . though wainwright \\' s vanity certainly doesn \\' t help , he does seem to have been given a nearly unworkable script . where are plot continuity and character development when you need them ? case in point : frankie page is the character that ( i assume ) we are supposed to identify and sympathize with , but we aren \\' t given any back story on her character , or any reason to like her . the extent of her character development seems to be that she is a hard - working hairdresser ( who can somehow afford a cavernous apartment on the top floor of her building ) and she \\' s kind of cute , so let \\' s start the bleeding ! the fact that she \\' s clearly not the brightest bulb in the drawer doesn \\' t help , either . according to frankie page , what is the first thing to do after receiving mysterious wounds on your wrists and back ? go clubbing ! sure , that makes sense . arquette , byrne , and pryce give it the old college try , but their characters are so one - dimensional that they just appear to be sleepwalking . scenes between arquette and byrne that were probably supposed to be sexually charged fall almost embarrassingly flat , because the setup of the romantic subplot is so clumsily handled that it almost reaches the point of becoming laughable . even though frankie page \\' s life is falling apart before her very eyes , she still finds the time to hit on a priest who wanders in to her hair salon . even more curiously , he seems to be interested in her advances . father andrew \\' s religious doubt pops up so suddenly that it seems more silly than dramatic . as for pryce , he may as well wear a curled mustache and cackle , \" i \\' ll get you , my pretty , \" for all the depth his cardinal houseman is afforded . trust me , i \\' m not revealing anything by telling you pryce turns out to be a villain . what \\' s worse , after being faced with dull characters and the prospect of having annoying camera tricks and loud music jammed down our throats , we now have to contend with a story that starts off in one direction , veers off in another , then another , and ends up being totally incomprehensible . first of all , the film doesn \\' t even bother to explain what should be very simple plot details . how does frankie get the stigmata merely by touching a rosary ? how come an atheist like her was chosen , since father andrew mentions that only very devout believers have ever received stigmata ? actually , i \\' m not sure what frankie was posessed by . supposedly , stigmata occurs when one is posessed by the holy spirit , but the film later has her being posessed by the dead priest , and later by some evil spirit ( i think ) . which one is it ? the answer to this question , of course , is very simple : the possessing entity in each scene is determined by whichever effects and flashy camera work mr . wainwright wants to use this time . furthermore , the ending is a ridiculously neat little wrap - up , and the filmmakers compound this problem by ultimately turning the film into a diatribe against the catholic church . if you do any research at all about the gospel of st . thomas , you \\' ll find that it is not being suppressed by the church ( as the film seems to claim ) , but that it is readily available at your local library . there \\' s nothing the catholics need to worry about , though . \" stigmata \\' s \" religion is so off - base that it can \\' t be confused for anything remotely resembling the real catholic church . if they wanted to portray catholic priests as mobsters , they should have gone all - out and equipped them with sharkskin suits and tommy guns , which would have been far more interesting . i \\' m not catholic ; in fact , i don \\' t care much for the catholic church , but its cartoonish misrepresentation in this film should not be considered realistic by any means . it \\' s rare to see a film that fails on as many levels as \" stigmata \" does . it \\' s not thought - provoking , though it would like to be , and it is definitely not scary , though it pretends to be . i \\' m not sure why they tried to pass this off as a horror film , because there is absolutely nothing scary about the story . maybe it \\' s an attempt to cover up the fact that none of the scenes have any dramatic weight whatsoever . the initial shock of seeing arquette covered with blood is dulled by the fact that it happens over , and over , and over . like so many films of the mtv generation , this one suffers from overkill . so much is overdone in \" stigmata , \" that it eventually has no effect on the audience , leaving us to pick out the film \\' s ( many ) flaws . i \\' m also still trying to figure out why the quotation they take from the gospel of st . thomas is so earth - shattering . when we finally hear it , the saying sounds like something every five - year - old learns on their first day of sunday school , which means that for all its flash , the whole film is really much ado about nothing . the dog days of summer usually produce one monstrous dog , and \" stigmata \" is it .',\n",

. the soft - core sex sequences are generic , and don \\' t generate much heat . the lesbian kisses can \\' t hold a candle to those in bound . theresa russell and denise richards have only token topless appearances ( neve campbell , possessing an iron - clad \" no nudity \" clause in her contract , keeps her clothes more or less on ) . the film \\' s greatest curiosity is a full frontal shot of kevin bacon climbing out of the shower . maybe a few girls will skip seeing a fully - clothed leonardo dicaprio for the thirteenth time in titanic to catch a glimpse of what kyra sedgwick ( mrs . kevin bacon ) is familiar with . the director of wild things is john mcnaughton , whose last effort was the finely - tuned psychological thriller , normal life . that movie featured copious sex , a pair of real characters , and a powerful script . it \\' s difficult to believe that something this shallow could come from the same film maker . but i suppose we all need to put food on the table . mcnaughton appears to have completely lost his way here , in what is obviously a stab at mainstream success ( his previous wide - release picture , mad dog and glory , was a box - office disappointment ) . quick cuts and pretty sunrises can \\' t even begin to cover up this movie \\' s flaws . the main character ( and i use that term lightly , since no one in wild things shows more than an occasional flash of personality ) is sam lombardo ( matt dillon ) , a guidance counselor at florida \\' s blue bay high school . a student , the deliciously curvaceous kelly van ryan ( denise richards ) , has a crush on him . one afternoon , she comes to his house to wash his car , and , when she leaves , her clothing is torn . after confessing to her mother ( theresa russell ) that she was raped , she goes to the police station , where she tells her story to detectives ray duquette ( kevin bacon ) and gloria perez ( daphne rubin - vega ) . they are skeptical about here claims until another girl , suzie toller ( neve campbell ) , comes forward with a similar tale . meanwhile , sam , convinced that he \\' s being set up , goes to a shyster lawyer ( bill murray ) for help . the acting in wild things isn \\' t very good , but none of the principals have much to work with . this is definitely not a character - based motion picture . not only does the ludicrous screenplay ignore the possibility that someone in the audience may have a triple - digit i . q . , but it doesn \\' t bother to give any of the on - screen individuals even a hint of depth . the men and women populating the picture are there to look nice , but nothing more . matt dillon is given plenty of opportunities to flex his biceps . neve campbell gets to model the slutty look . denise richards strikes a fetching pose in a see - through , one - piece bathing suit . and nothing in the film gets a rise out of kevin bacon . the only one who \\' s even remotely interesting is bill murray , and he seems to think he \\' s in comedy , not a thriller ( maybe he \\' s got the right idea ) . columbia pictures has specifically requested that critics not reveal the film \\' s ending , which prompts the question : which ending do they want kept secret ? wild things has no less than three ( one occurs during the end credits , so stay seated ) , all of which are jaw - droppingly absurd -- a feat that joe eszterhas ( the writer of basic instinct and showgirls ) would be impressed by . thanks to jeffrey kimball \\' s polished , kinetic cinematography , wild things always looks great , and george s . clinton \\' s score keeps it pulsing and throbbing . but , no matter how shiny the superficial sheen is , this is still trash , and , like all garbage , it stinks .',\n",

( note that the film has no connection with the 1975 exorcist - rip off behind the door , but for some unexplained reason was given this related title for release in the usa and australia . ) this story focuses on dora , a women set upon by a malevolent spirit that channels itself through her young son marco . the film opens with dora , her son and second husband bruno returning to a house by the sea that was the scene of her first husband ' s suicide and her subsequent trauma 7 years earlier . they hope to put the past behind them , but as small accidents start to befall dora - usually while bruno is away on business - she starts to suspect that marco ( played with uncanny ability by 8 year old david colin jr . ) is somehow involved in the strange goings on . to reveal any more of the story would be unfair . suffice to say that this artfully paced study of a woman suffering a nervous breakdown offers an intriguing plot , loads of atmosphere and solid acting , though the dialogue is somewhat weakened by the dubbing into english . bava coaches a surprisingly good performance from the usually wooden daria nicolodi , wife of famed italian horror director dario argento . her character is invested with sufficient depth to allow the audience real empathy with dora ' s troubled soul . the music by italian ensemble libra is also effective , mixing odd - sounding 70 ' s rock with classic gothic piano sequences . and there is at least one moment - brilliantly engineered by bava - that is guaranteed to lift you ten feet out of your chair . yet for italian horror , the bloodletting here is surprisingly minimal . lamberto bava and francesco barbieri ' s script is more concerned with deeper , psychological terrors , with themes of guilt and suffering , with the notion that what we sow will shall - somewhere , somehow - eventually reap . scholars of the genre take note : beyond the door ii is stylish , chilling , and essential .\",\n",

              " (\"note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . be forewarned . at the end of the day , those reflecting upon the debacle that is the avengers would do well to take note that warning clouds loomed on the horizon for the project well before warner bros . made the contentious decision to abandon preview press screenings and scrapped plans for a gala premiere . this highly - anticipated film rendition of the cult television show was originally slotted for an early june opening , where it would have gone head - to - head against the rival studios ' heavy hitters ; its eventual demotion to a less potent mid - august opening was an obvious early indication of the studio ' s lack of confidence with the picture . and with good reason . this is a joyless exercise of a film , held together by a barely coherent plot and lacking any semblance of excitement , thrills or wit . remarkable in its banality and brutally uninvolving , the avengers is a catastrophic mess which immediately invites comparisons to last year ' s case study in style over substance , joel schumacher ' s much - loathed batman & robin . ( indeed , both films even feature appalling , ridiculous sequences which find central characters dressed up in fuzzy oversized costumes . ) uma thurman , who takes on the salacious role of the catsuit - clad , karate - chopping emma peel immortalized by diana rigg , was the only bright spot in the aforementioned schumacher disaster , imbuing her poison ivy with a dose of sassiness and sly wit that gave audiences something to smile at amidst the cinematic carnage . unfortunately , the same can ' t be said here , where she and cohort ralph fiennes ( our new john steed , taking over for patrick macnee ) demonstrate no appreciable chemistry whatsoever , fatally crippling the picture as they volley fizzling repartee back and forth and trade double - entendres with all the enthusiasm of two actors painfully aware that they ' re on board a sinking ship . at this rate , usually - splendid actor mr . fiennes may never make the transition from arthouse apollo to mainstream leading man -- his tepid turn here will make as much of an inroad as his commendably seedy performance in the regrettably - neglected kathyrn bigelow film strange days . the duo * look * the part -- and admittedly the avengers is , more than most , heavily dependent upon style -- but they ' re no fun to watch , and i found myself growing increasingly distant and annoyed by the lack of spark between the two cheekily ironic characters as they navigated through the picture ' s caper - esque plot . when not checking my wristwatch or shifting restlessly in my seat , i began to alleviate the boredom by considering how this all might have played out had the filmmakers chose to go instead with that erstwhile emma as our mrs . peel -- no , not kate beckinsale ( although the notion now intrigues me ) , but gwyneth paltrow , who was originally in the running for the part and can veritably handle a spot - on english accent . if nothing else , it ' d at least be highly entertaining for the incongruous sight of the vaguely twiggish young actress kicking butt . the story , such as it is , involves the ever - bemused tandem of steed and peel combating the malevolent sir august de wynter ( sean connery ) , an eccentric aristocrat threatening the safety of the nation with his climate - controlling contraption . ( they also sip a lot of tea . ) overlooking some goofy cloning nonsense and quirky hijinx involving our protagonists ' superiors , it sounds far better than it plays , and is rendered almost indecipherable by blatant post - production tinkering ; it ' s clearly evident that the picture has been cut to shreds . the avengers was never about gripping drama , and our heroes accordingly never take villainous sir august very seriously , but given the lack of cohesion in the plot and the lack of menace conveyed by the buffoonish maniac , it ' s all decidedly uncompelling . mr . connery , who ' s onscreen barely long enough to register an impression , approaches the role like a man fulfilling a contractual obligation , simultaneously chewing the scenery while unable to hide his disinterest . at least it all looks good . this is a genuinely handsome production , with fine costume design by anthony powell and crisply shot by roger pratt . in particular , the gleaming production design by stuart craig commands attention , adeptly drawing elements both old and new in order to depict this great britain . there are a handful of striking visual moments in the film , including an attack by a swarm of giant robotic bees and a nice shot of steed and peel finding a way to walk on water , but the film is so unremittingly dull that even these instances fail to stir interest or raise pulse rates . by the time the film ' s climax had arrived , my interest was not with the sight of steed and sir august slugging it out amidst crashing waves and thundering rain , but with the quickest escape route from the theatre . not coincidentally , the enticing bits of visual bravura were the shots assembled into the movie ' s remarkable trailer , a savvy piece of work which ironically is infinitely more appealing that the feature film itself ; the first promo which made the rounds in early spring is probably my favourite studio trailer so far this year . it ' s everything that the avengers is not -- saucy , clever , engaging , and entertaining . a crushing disappointment , the film is one of the worst outings of the year -- too drearily awful to be savoured as gleefully bad , too polished to overlook its deficiencies . there may be upcoming pictures that are even more lifeless than the avengers , but i sure hope not .\",\n",

stakes poker . that \\' s right . i \\' m not sure if it \\' s his main source of income , but from what i \\' ve heard , the guy occasionally comes away with $ 20 , 000 at a time . and there you were , thinking i was going to tell you he was doing off - broadway theater . you silly goose . well , gabe kaplan isn \\' t in the movie rounders , nor is the film about the actor come gambler \\' s life . but rounders is about poker , and gabe plays poker , and i thought that was kind of a neat connection . sorry about the segue , or lack thereof . matt damon plays mike mcdermott , a law student who also has a singular talent for the game of poker . he \\' s been playing for a while , and more than being proficient , he has caught the bug . he goes to all the underground games in new york city , knows the regulars , and knows how to win . in the beginning of the film , he \\' s built up a nice thirty grand nest egg , which he takes to the speakeasy - type gaming parlor where the big boys play . mike is there to make his bid into the upper echelon by staking it all against teddy kgb ( john malkovich ) , an oreo - munching cardshark with ties to the russian mafia . mike has the potential to take a large pot and go to vegas and buy into the world series of poker , but instead he loses it all in a single hand . months later , he \\' s paying his way through law school by driving a delivery truck . when mike \\' s best friend and poker buddy worm ( edward norton ) finishes his jail term for hustling some students , he wants to pick up right were they left off , working as a team to part others with their betting cash . although mike has stopped playing cards as a promise to his girlfriend and fellow law student , jo ( gretchen mol ) , worm connives mike into playing once more , and mike , bitten again by the bug , slides down that slippery slope , risking his relationship , education , and reputation as playing poker again becomes the focus of his life . to make a film about gambling , a filmmaker will usually have to play up the glamorous side to get the audience behind the characters . this is because few moviegoers will care a whole lot about some guy in a leisure suit or terry cloth shirt sitting at a folding card table with a stogie in his mouth . rounders , however , seems to go more for the latter than the former . the card clubs mike and worm frequent aren \\' t very glamorous at all . there \\' s a basement , a lodge with elk heads on the wall , a goulash joint - these are the kinds of locales in which director john dahl sets his shots . except for one brief instance when the two players visit atlantic city , the film is bereft of the flashing lights of the casinos or the pleasant color of the green felt table . the reason rounders still captures our attention is because it is less about the game of poker than it is about the personalities which enjoy and are slaves to it . we \\' re given a nice set of interesting characters with clear motivations , and good actors to play them . matt damon is very natural as mike , who struggles between his desire to play the straight and narrow by finishing law school , and answering what may be his true calling , playing professional poker . ed norton \\' s worm is truly a worm , always looking for the angle and playing everyone for what they \\' re worth . john turturro , who amazes me with his acting range , tones it down in this film by playing joey knish , a virtual poker prodigy in his time who now plays the underground games to make rent and child support payments . he \\' s both a friend and mentor to mike , and turturro \\' s low - key performance is totally convincing , just as john malkovich \\' s heavily - accented teddy kgb is imposing as an adversarial dragon mike must slay to prove himself . martin landau is also thrown into the mix as one of mike \\' s law professors , abe petrovsky . while landau slips well into the role , his character , spitting out personal anecdotes about staying true to one \\' s self , facilitates the channeling of the storyline toward a predictable ending . perhaps the weak link in the otherwise formidable line - up of acting talent , however , is gretchen mol who just didn \\' t seem to have much presence on screen . she \\' s a genuine peach to look at , kind of a cross between actress renee zellweger and singer jewel ( and i wouldn \\' t be surprised if the three of them formed some kind of blond - haired triumvirate and attempted to take over the world ) , but her delivered lines seemed very flat , and i found myself looking for matt damon \\' s reactions instead . a good thing about rounders is that it doesn \\' t get bogged down in the character development and statement making so much that it can \\' t find time for humor . the film is peppered nicely with scenes that both make you laugh and keep the pacing going , such as a sequence where mike and worm move rapidly around new york from one game to the next , in widely different locales . one game in a cigar club had me in stitches . \" i love the sweetness of this dark maduro wrapper , \" says one of the players , clearly more interested in displaying his pretentiousness over the cigar in one hand than in the cards in his other . i was hoping mike and worm would really take these guys . with all the poker being played , rounders had the potential to be very confusing . you might think you know a lot about poker , but think again . luckily , we \\' re given a narration by damon during the more intricate moments to explain what \\' s going on . the narrations are more informative than intrusive , and apprise us of what the stakes are and why certain players want to do the things they do . it \\' s nice that as the characters develop , so does our comprehension of their world . as a film about success and survival in the realm of underground poker , rounders delivers in spades . wait ! as a film about the culture of cards , rounders is an ace . hang on ! packed with great acting and great characters , rounders is a full house . okay , i guess that \\' s enough . oh , by the way , if you ever want to get into a game with ol \\' gabe kaplan , be sure to bring a note from epstein \\' s mother .',\n",

              " ('i \\' m not sure i should be writing a review of the witches of eastwick , because i \\' m not sure just what the hell ( pardon the expression ) was going on in it . however , i can express the most important observation i made of it , i . e . i didn \\' t like it . if i had to summarize this film , i think i \\' d conclude it was an updating of one of those old new england folk tales of someone selling their souls to old scratch and how they try to get out of the deal . that \\' s the kernel of it , anyway . tossed into this are little bits and pieces that occasionally seem to be saying something about men and women , feminism , the role of the devil , modern reformers , and friendship . unfortunately , little or no effort is ever made to follow up and elucidate on these concepts ; they \\' re simply thrown out and then left to rot while the film goes on apace . actually , i think that most of the audience was even more confused than i was . they came in expecting some kind of supernatural comedy , on the level of ghostbusters , and were a bit confused to be getting a folk tale with philosophical overtones . they laughed , or tried to laugh , at moments that were either barely funny , or much more horrible than funny , as if that could bend the film away from it \\' s rather frightening direction . three women ( cher , susan sarandon , and michelle pfieffer ) live in eastwick , a small midwestern town . one night , while drinking late into the evening , they begin wishing for the ideal man to drop into their lives . in seeming answer to their idle daydreams , a wealthy eccentric moves into a mansion on the hill and seduces each one by attempting to be everything they want him to be . he soon shows evidence of mystical -- perhaps demonic -- power , and his devotion to the women \\' s merest fantasies or wishes has dangerous overtones . even worse , when ignored his moods become ugly , and he mistreats the women for spurning him . anyway , the problems : all three female characters are fairly uninteresting , and several are cardboard stereotypes , especially sarandon \\' s character . we never get inside them , never feel sympathetic to them , because their dialogue and personalities seem pretty bland . as for nicholson , well , even the devil needs a direction to go in , and while darryl van horne is the most interesting character in the movie ( due to the grace of the screenwriter and , more importantly , nicholson \\' s acting ) , he still can \\' t be yanked in one direction and then another without making him a little vague . and then there \\' s the special effects . not in themselves -- they weren \\' t that good -- but their overuse . i was almost positive , until i saw the credits , that the witches of eastwick was either produced by alexander salkind ( who has turned out the slop named superman ii and iii and supergirl ) , because of the big name actors in dopy stunts , or stephen spielberg , after the 18th vomit scene and the nicholson - blown - down - the - street stunt . nope , it \\' s another bunch of guys , and directed by george miller , who has shown great skill with stunts / special effects before ( the road warrior , \" nightmare at 20 , 00 feet \" episode of twilight zone : the movie ) but apparently doesn \\' t know when to turn off the wind machine and let his people act . f \\' gawds sake , guys , this is jack nicholson ! let him loose ! let him grin demonically ! skip the splitting earth and fake lightning ! watching the scene where nicholson is tossed out of the car by the voodoo doll , all i could think of was , \" what a waste \" . if you \\' re going to use slapstick like that , use it up on pee wee herman . nicholson does what he can with the role , and when he can find his bearings , can be extremely good ( the scene in the church , for instance ) , but most of the time , he seems a bit stiff , as if he \\' s not sure what he should be doing next . and no wonder . this script goes all over the map , giving you the feeling that it \\' d just love to be allegory , but it \\' s not sure about what -- maybe if you give it time it \\' ll think of something . so what is the witches of eastwick ? a horror movie ? a folk tale ? a comedy ? a statement about women ? an examination of the religious right or comparitive morality ? i tend to think of the image that seems to dominate the movie for me . . . watching someone regurgitate half - digested bits of food and cherry pits all over rooms , people , the screen , and ultimately , the audience . in other words , a mess . ( $ 2 . 00 ) if you like nicholson enough to watch him here ; maybe 25 % of his charm is able to make it through the logjams of others .',\n",

! ? ) , comes off as stoic , stilted and caricatured ( it appears as though she was a vulcan geisha in a former life ) . and obi - wan , although mcgregor makes him very endearing , has so little screen time that he \\' s nothing but a robin to qui - gon jinn \\' s batman . however , mcgregor does struggle manfully to infuse this surprisingly small supporting role with a spark of genuine insight and humanity , and he does a good job . he also absolutely nails alec guiness \\' ( obi - wan in episode 4 - 6 ) scottish accent , and that really makes his presence in the film more profound than it might have been otherwise . in fact , lucas seems to bank on that preexisting knowledge quite a bit , and that \\' s one of the problems with this film . i would never call myself a \" star wars \" fan - especially not considering what it means to be a fanatic these days - but i \\' ve always enjoyed the films along with everyone else in america . however , if you are the one person in america who * hasn \\' t * seen the films at all or even recently , or who doesn \\' t bother to brush - up on the names of obscure characters , you may be hopelessly lost . for example , one of the film \\' s main ( nefarious ) characters is senator palpatine . for those of you not recently steeped in \" star wars \" trivia , emperor palpatine is that scary hooded apparition who was darth vader \\' s master in \" return of the jedi \" and \" empire strikes back . \" so , obviously , his appearance in \" phantom menace \" is meant to stir some echoes of his later role in the series , thus making his role here more meaningful . a lot of the movie is like that . r2 - d2 and c - 3po make token appearances , and it \\' s obvious that lucas is banking on the audience \\' s pre - existing fondness for them . . . because he doesn \\' t do much to add to it in any way . same goes for jabba the hutt , who doesn \\' t look as much mean here as he does corpulent and lazy . even * planets * make foreshadowing guest appearances in this film - tatooine ( the desert world where luke grew up ) , coruscant ( the cloud city from \" empire strikes back \" ) , and alderaan ( leia \\' s home planet - which we never actually see - that gets blown up in \" star wars \" ) show up or are mentioned briefly in passing . what \\' s the result of tying so many plot points and characters to future films ? the answer is that this one seems surprisingly empty . there \\' s no meat - no substance - that makes you want to love the characters as they are , not as they will be . another problem is that there are actually * too many * alien characters in the film . i was distracted by the fact that two of the main evil characters - strange looking aliens who looked like gila monsters - had mouths that barely moved , making them look more like muppets than actual characters . and jar jar binks , a silly roger rabbitish amphibious character , is intended as comic relief , but what he really becomes is annoying - and fast . unlike chewbacca and c - 3po , who got their humanity ( if you \\' ll pardon the expression ) from their interactions with the human characters , jar jar is often left to interact mostly with others of his kind , at times making the movie seem like nothing more than a very expensive \" teenage mutant ninja turtles . \" furthermore , the dialogue is often stilted and corny , and sometimes downright infantile , thereby rendering some characters into nothing more than bystanders to the plot . oddly , this isn \\' t just * my * judgment - lucas has said that he designed this film for kids . well , he \\' s done a good job . the hero of this film , of course , is young anakin , but it was very hard for me to feel any kinship or identify with an eight - year - old boy . that \\' s not jake lloyd \\' s fault , though - he does a good job of being a cute kid , which is apparently all lucas asked of him . that \\' s another mistake , of course , because the cute tyke becomes darth vader . warning : spoilers ahead ! ! ! ! in my opinion , there was not nearly enough foreshadowing of anakin \\' s future evil in the film . the boy is all blond flowing hair and rosy cheeks , and there \\' s nothing more than a spark of aggression in him throughout the entire movie . he has a doting mother ( pernilla august , making her first english - language film ) and is a slave to a gross flying gnome on tatooine . but the only indication the audience gets that this kid isn \\' t all hearts and roses is yoda \\' s hesitation in allowing him to train as a jedi under qui - gon jinn . his explanation ? \" his future is clouded . \" ( warning : major spoiler ahead . enter at your own risk . ) of course , the noble qui - gon dies at the hand of darth maul , a scary - looking sith lord who excels at the jedi arts , but has turned to the dark side . this dude has maybe two lines in the entire movie , but he establishes his presence through his amazing moves with his double - sided lightsaber , and his scary facial makeup . because qui - gon never gets a chance to train the young anakin in the ways of the force , obi - wan , qui - gon \\' s young padawan apprentice ( one level below knightdom ) , must take over the training himself . so , at the end of the movie , we end where the saga actually begins - with obi - wan kenobi and his young apprentice , anakin \" darth vader \" skywalker . did this story need to be told ? i would say no . but is it a worthwhile movie to see ? absolutely . if you don \\' t enter the theater with jedi - size expectations , and you simply want to be treated to an enjoyable visual spectacle , then this is your movie . the tatooine pod races are a triumph of effects and computer animation . the digitalized backgrounds on some of the planets are an astonishing sight . and yoda and young obi - wan are worth seeing for their origins in a simpler , happier time . above all , this is a fun movie . not deep , not meaningful , and not profound . but fun . maybe next time , lucas will hire lawrence kasdan to co - write the script , and the guy who directed \" empire \" will direct . because if lucas does the next one himself , it will be lacking the one thing it needs the most - potential . : )',\n",

dog sort ( the recent tom hanks / meg ryan - starrer \" you \\' ve got mail \" immediately pops to mind ) , but with this film , i grew to care more about the characters and their plight . the film starts off noticably well as amy travels up north and first meets virgil . the massaging sequences were strangely erotic , maybe even more so than the later actual \" love scenes , \" and as their romantic involvement quickly developed , the film was both entertaining and sweet , and there was clearly a lot of chemistry between the two . these joyous moments early on balanced out well with the later scenes in which their relationship is seriously tested due to a contrast in the life styles that they have always known , with virgil completely used to being blind and having a comforting , peaceful life in the country to amy \\' s eventful life in the \" big city . \" the other major compliment that must be given to the film are the nearly flawless performances across the board . val kilmer , usually cast in the \" macho \" type of role , was always believable as a blind person , and playing his character was probably a little more tricky than it appears . it was up to kilmer to not come off as someone to pity , but to sympathize with , and he pulled it off . mira sorvino , who made a spectacular debuting splash in 1995 \\' s hilarious woody allen comedy , \" mighty aphrodite , \" for which she won a well - deserved oscar as a kind - hearted , but ditzy hooker , is a standout here . although she has made some mediocre film choices since then ( 1997 \\' s \" mimic , \" 1998 \\' s \" the replacement killers \" ) , she always has managed to come out unscathed , and it is with \" at first sight \" that she finally has another juicy role to play . in a truthful climactic scene set in amy \\' s apartment between she and virgil , sorvino proves to be one of the most gifted young actresses around today , and has a flare for both comedic and dramatic pieces . kelly mcgillis , who could have easily come off as the \" bad , \" one - dimensional sister , instead is also given an unexpectedly multifaceted character to play as a woman who may be overly protective but simply cares for her brother . finally , nathan lane , who is usually a little too over - the - top , is appropriately restrained as a vision therapist . the one misstep of \" at first sight \" is in its treatment of the medical procedure done on virgil . very little is ever said or discussed concerning it , and when the surgery occurs , it is so briefly glimpsed at that it is impossible to see what is being done to his eyes . perhaps the reason this aspect of the film was not more in - depth was that the makers were afraid it would gross out audiences , but i would personally take realism , even if it is graphic , any day over simply giving the explanation of the surgery the cold shoulder . in \" awakenings , \" the patients and illness were far more satisfyingly portrayed . because of how strong the screenplay , written by steve levitt , is in the way it deals with the main relationship , and because of the fabulous performances from kilmer and sorvino , the film \\' s few problems can be swept over to the side . the adult way that the romance is depicted by director irwin winkler is , no doubt , in respect to the real - life couple that the film was inspired by , who are still together after many years ( even though the setting of the film was changed to new york ) . since january is usually the time of year that is known as the dumping ground from bad movies , \" at first sight \" comes as a refreshing and sophisticated change of pace .',\n",

( that \\' s exactly what mj used to wear all the time ! ) . unfortunately , making fun of generalizations about a past era is too easy to be rewarding . that \\' s not to say the movie isn \\' t funny . screenwriter tim herlihy has written for sandler before ( billy madison and happy gilmore ) , and the two make a good combination . herlihy knows what sort of jokes sandler is good at and has tailored the script to his straight - faced , smart - aleck style . let \\' s hope herlihy and sandler stick together for a few more projects because this movie really won me over . with barrymore \\' s charm and sandler \\' s heart , it was hard to go wrong .',\n",

depalma and the screenwriter , david koepp , are extremely credible people in their respective fields , and have been known for bringing life and complexity to mysteries such as this . depalma , who idolizes hitchcock to death , has done many a film like this , such as his masterpiece , \" blow out , \" where a movie soundman uses movie elements to uncover a conspiracy piece by piece . but granted , depalma at least makes it intriguing to watch , what with his over - the - top shot set - ups , notably the beginning and a sequence where the camera pans over top of a bunch of rooms in the hotel , forgetting anything about boundaries . at least his direction makes up partly for it . then there \\' s koepp , who showed such great ability at making a character \\' s flaws come to life like he did in depalma \\' s earlier \" carlito \\' s way , \" a film that dove right into the life and past of its character and examined him extremely well . he can write a flawed character , but his rick santoro seems to be just a half - assed effort . he \\' s flawed , and we can see redemption if the story wasn \\' t so formulaic . a scene towards the end where he has to make a fatal decision is cheapened by the fact that his answer has no emotional buildup . he may as well have said the opposite of what he says ; it would have at least gone with what the character was like . this is the most disappointing kind of film because it promises intelligence and complexity , because it promises disection of a flawed character and perhaps even redemption , then pulls the rug from under us just as we were about to be convinced it would be able to go all the way . as i was watching the first half hour , i couldn \\' t wait to see how the mystery would be unearthed , how many different perspectives he \\' d be given , and perhaps he \\' d have to make a choice between who \\' s he has to believe . now there \\' s a film . unfortunately , the film has two major deux ex machinas : one in the disasterous ending ; the other , about a half hour in when the film goes into autopilot and becomes a stale and recycled piece of crap we \\' ve seen all too much before , but never from someone like depalma .',\n",

( parenthetically , witness plato as well . in the republic , he attempted to launch the first systematic absolutist regime . not coincidentally he was something of a mystic himself , regularly assailing the passions . ) catholicism , as policy , attacks the passions as evil . it sees intercourse only as a means to perpetuate the species not as a way to pleasure . masturbation is considered a sin with the sacrament of penance necessary for absolution . this is religion , this is authoritarianism in its essence . as further evidence , the nazis had the same attitudes as the church on these matters . our culture , most of the cultures of the world have been steeped in this tradition for thousands of years . we can \\' t help but adopt , even internalize some of these same authoritarian attitudes , leading to a destructive split between the biological and social self . mickey and mallory knox internalized them , too , then through spontaneous sexual awareness sparked in each one of them by the presence of the other , discovered them , and began expurgating them from themselves and from the world in the process unifying themselves . it is a straightforward liberation through sex . as some good patriarch once observed , \" you can maintain control as long as everyone keeps their clothes on . \" m & m had a vision of what the world would be like without contradictions . they saw what civilization and culture and everyday life would be like under such conditions . \" the moment of realization is worth a thousand prayers , \" as mickey says . as a the most consistent and impassioned critic of western culture there is nietzsche applying his typical stridency to the matter : let us look each other in the face . we are hyberboreans -- we know well enough how remote our place is . \" neither by land nor by water will you find the road to the hyberboreans \" : even pindar , in his day , knew that much about us . beyond the north , beyond ice , beyond death -- our life , our happiness . . . . we have discovered that happiness ; we know the way ; we got our knowledge of it from thousands of years in the labyrinth . who else has found it ? -- the man of today ? -- \" i don \\' t know either the way out or the way in ; i am whatever doesn \\' t know either the way out or the way in \" -- so sighs the man of today . . . . this is the sort of modernity that made us ill -- we sickened in lazy peace , cowardly compromise , the whole virtuous dirtiness of the modern yea and nay . this tolerance and largeur of the heart that \" forgives \" everything because it \" understands \" everything is a sirocco to us . rather live amid the ice than among modern virtues and other such south - winds ! as far as i can tell , this is what the movie has to say . its alleged critique of the media is only secondary , tertiary , quaternary , subsidiary for sure . for example wayne gayle \\' s first report ends with some gen x dude saying , \" if i were a mass murderer i \\' d be mickey and mallory , \" in his most excellent bill and ted voice . on one level you cd make the humdrum observation that because the media had glamorized these two psychopaths that the uncritical , impressionable gen x dumb guy confused the matter and took them for heroes . it seems more likely that he made an independent judgement at a subconscious level recognizing what m & m were up to and confessing that if he had the balls to be so honest with himself he \\' d be just like them , killing and destroying what deserves it . let me exemplify what i \\' ve been saying by analyzing a scene from the film , namely the scene where mallory fucks the gas station attendant , kills him , and then castigates him for giving her \" the worst fuckin \\' head i \\' ve ever had in my life ! ! ! \" now , i never claimed that mickey and mallory had a perfect relationship , because demonstrably they didn \\' t , and this scene and the ones leading up to it show us this . sometimes they are the source of each others frustrations , but unwilling to kill each other , since they love each other so much and are responsible for each others liberation , they must kill in place of their lever . it \\' s no secret that in this scene mallory fantasized that her victim was mickey . as the attendant approached he took on mickey \\' s character in the eyes of mallory . she needed to kill him because of he kidnapped that girl in the hotel room and was having secret fantasies about her while making love to mallory . upon discovery , mallory views this as a betrayal , judges him , and commutes his sentence on someone else . the style of the movie is a whole \\' nother matter that i won \\' t get into very deeply but surely it is partially responsible for its power . let me just say that its editing has the opposite effect of a western with shots that linger forever on a salon entrance or the like suggesting the expansiveness , barreness and boredom of the frontier lifestyle . the rapid succession of all those 8mm , 16mm , 35mm images from various perspectives with a soundtrack sometimes in sync and sometimes out of sink instills a skittish , frenetic mood . also , jungian archetypes abound . these can \\' t help but trigger deep psychological responses we can barely understand especially when they flash across the screen for barely a few frames . some of the best scenes and lines that come to mind . ( quotes are paraphrased only ) : mickey to mallory : \" one of these days i \\' m gonna be cummin \\' for you , \" in prison , while mallory jacks mickey off . semen is a symbol for great potential and things to come . at the time they haven \\' t yet had sex nor have they killed anyone yet . the two of course go hand in hand . for an even more explicit semen scene see silence of the lambs . mickey during his marriage to mallory : \" as creator of my universe , i pronounce us man and wife . \" the way woody delivers this line is truly haunting , but telling , too . it reveals m & m are well on their way to expunging all their destructive tendencies and replacing them with positive ones . this is what mickey means by \" creator of my universe , \" he is giving himself or creating for himself healthy attitudes . it is not necessarily a schizophrenic retreat into solipsism as it first appears . scagnetti \\' s first meeting with mallory is through her pubic hair he plucks from the gas station attendant \\' s mouth . the indian sage releasing mallory \\' s father , who was reincarnated as a snake : \" old man , go be a snake , \" after telling his \" snake story \" that ends with \" bitch , you knew i was a snake . \" after mickey shoots this sage to death during a bewildering nightmare , mallory says , \" you killed life ! ! ! \" this is another telling quote because it implies they didn \\' t see themselves as killers of life . then what were they killing up to that time ? in some case just those zombies faking their way through life , the living dead , as it were . in other cases , all the anti - life forces , the cops and their parents . the butterfly just before the movie shifts into the prison . it of course symbolizes rebirth . dr . emil reingold , as portrayed by steven wright , passing judgement on m & m : \" mickey and mallory know the difference between right and wrong , they just don \\' t give a damn . \" this is reminiscent of nietzsche \\' s whole philosophy , and maybe a direct reference to his beyond good and evil . mickey : \" the rabbit says the moment of realization is worth 1000 prayers . \" mickey ( again in his interview ) : \" me and you , we are not the same species . \" notice when the escape is in progress we get some role reversals in terms of leadership and control . mickey the prisoner becomes the leader of his little gang . the wardens become prisoners and the civilians like wayne gayle and his producer follow the leader , no matter who it is . mickey : how ya feelin \\' ? wayne : fucking great ! mickey : you got the feelin \\' ? wayne : i \\' m alive . i \\' m alive for the first fuckin \\' time ! what an incredible transformation this is . he got the feeling and he couldn \\' t contain himself . what a feeling . that feeling of metaphysical freedom that you can create your own universe . mickey when almost caught in a dead end , \" think , think , think , think . \" go figure it out . dwight ( tommy lee jones ) in general , because he may be the sickest fuck in the whole film . his whole attitude can be summed up with , \" destroy them ! ! ! \"',\n",

              " ('contrary to the title , \" the boxer \" is not another rocky story only this time spliced with some cold hard politics . it \\' s actually three movies in one : a political film , a boxing film , and a love story . all of these work in their own respects and have some pretty decent balancing betwixt the three elements of the story , but somehow it seems kind of cliched and unoriginal . we \\' ve seen it all before , and we \\' re just not blown away with it like we should be . oh well . it \\' s still an excellent irish story . \" the boxer \" of the title is danny flynn ( jim sheridan staple daniel day - lewis ) , an ex - ira member who gets out of a belfast prison after 14 years , and finds out that his troubles are far from over . first off , the ira is having a small civil war between its leader joe hamill ( brian cox ) , and one of its sub - leaders , harry ( gerard mcsorley ) , both having opposing views on getting many of their members out of jail . while this is going on , danny and his old drunkard buddie , ike ( ken stott , who played the chief inspector in danny boyle \\' s \" shallow grave \" ) , re - open an old gym which allows the two opposing religios sects , protestant and catholics , to work together . danny not only begins teaching kids how to box , but has stayed in great shape whilst in prison , and is ready to start boxing real people again . and danny runs into his ex - love , maggie ( \" breaking the waves \" \\' s emily watson ) , who hasn \\' t seen him since he went in . they don \\' t easily start up their romance again because she \\' s the wife of a prisoner whom she married during danny \\' s tenure in prison , and also has a son , liam ( ciaran fitzgerald ) , from him , whom liam is hoping will get out soon . but the two are slowly re - drawn to eachother again , and this begins to complicate things . the political story is nothing really special but works in itself . we \\' ve seen it many a time before , but it \\' s at least interesting , sometimes emotional , and even riveting at times . there \\' s a big riot towards the middle of the film which is frightening in its brutality and honesty . the boxing story is very minor to the story , but does represent people coming together to fight eachother fairly , and even with good sportsmanship . there are only a few boxing scenes , but they \\' re never like \" raging bull \" / let \\' s - strip - down - the - sport - to - its - bones brilliant . they \\' re more realistic , and instead of bone crunching , we hear the sound of the gloves hitting eachother , which is slightly unerving at times . and i didn \\' t know daniel day - lewis was in such good shape . but the backbone of the story is the love one . because these characters are given such horrible circumstances , and since the two leads have such great chemistry together , we really feel for their plight . as the film goes on , and circumstances get worse and worse , the characters have to make real human decisions , and we can sympathize with them as humans not characters . this is how you write a love story - take note , hollywood . these elements are pretty much equally balanced , with each of the parts of the stories working hand - in - hand with eachother . i loved how each of the different parts of the plot mattered , and sometimes spilled over into the next . it made sure that we didn \\' t just care for one of them . i \\' m not saying they \\' re all equally great , because the love story really carries the film , but at least they all work out respectively . the acting is amazing , with day - lewis and watson giving excellent performances and showing great chemistry . i \\' m not sure if they \\' re oscar - nominee bound , but they \\' re very good . in the supporting roles , billy cox is greatly sympathetic as the ira leader losing control of his daughter and his workers . but the film is stolen acting wise by ken stott as ike , who is just a great scene stealer . the direction and co - writing by jim sheridan ( with the other co - writing credit going to terry george ) is excellent , rounding out the characters well , but not pacing everything greatly . i noticed that the first half was very leisurely ( yet fascinating ) , but the second half whirls by at a quick pace , and ends much too quickly . more time could have been spent thinking up the ending , since it does seem quite sloppy . though \" the boxer \" is a good film , it never achieves the greatness that it should . sure , it \\' s a masterpiece compared to most of the hollywood drivel we usually get , but on it \\' s own , it just could have been better . but it still works out , gives us a great love story combined with a political and boxing drama , and features great acting . even if it could have been better , this \\' ll do .',\n",

              " ('it stands as a moment one will not soon forget : a giant , green ogre flips through the pages of a cliche fairy tale , narrating it with every bit of dull inspiration that the story holds . this leads one to believe that this serves as the prologue to shrek , dreamworks \\' second computer animated feature , but in a pricelessly hilarious bit of cinema , a page of this tale serves as that ogre \\' s toilet paper . from this opening moment , one can infer shrek \\' s defying of all expectations regarding it as a standard , disney - esque fairy tale . although rampant moments of hilarity dot shrek , the true charm of the film lies in the bold elements of friendship , courage , and acceptance , excelled by outstanding direction , stunning actor voice work , and most importantly , a witty screenplay with more going on than meets the eye . while shrek features an abundance of humor related directly toward adults , positive friendship values aimed at younger children fulfill the storyline : shrek , the previously mentioned ogre , holds a position of absolute nothingness within his community . the jolly green giant meets a fellow outsider , known only as the donkey ( his species ) who talks , and although he remains reluctant to warm up to him for a good portion of time , shrek eventually comes to a mutual understanding with him by acknowledging their common state as outcasts of the world . the pair team up to retrieve princess fiona from a castle guarded by a dragon for the powerful lord farquaad , learning quite a bit about each other and themselves along the way . their friendship exhibits the core theme of the need for someone to lean on , exemplifying to any child who may witness the film that acting as an honest companion can unquestionably affect someone . shrek and donkey endure as supposed freaks of nature due only to their differences from others but cling to each other for support and guidance along their journey . courage demonstrates itself within two major storylines : along the journey to rescue fiona , donkey \\' s immeasurable cowardice reveals itself . whether he encounters walking over a shaky bridge or living alone , donkey withholds fears that he continuously puts aside without self - acknowledgment . but the yapping donkey must face his phobias when presented with the giant , fire - breathing dragon guarding fiona ; either he dies from terror or he triumphs with courage . he wisely chooses courage by pretending as if no dangerous situation actually faces him , allowing the donkey to overcome a horror that likely only continued due to his insistence of them . secondly , upon shrek \\' s and donkey \\' s redeeming of princess fiona , the ogre finds the princess has plans for whomever saves her : to satisfy her desire for a ( human ) knight in shining armor . throughout this storyline , shrek faces his deep , perpetual misgivings of inhering as an ogre and struggles to determine how he will reveal his true identity to fiona . an ongoing struggle occurs between himself and his reluctance of the truth , but eventually , shrek courageously conquers his fear by telling the forbidden secret to fiona . children can realize from donkey and shrek that fear remains only as complicated as one makes it ; if one sets his / her mind to overcoming something in particular , endless possibilities exist . after the friendships and courage prevail , the three central characters at the heart of shrek must take one more stretch of development : acceptance . surprisingly , fiona holds a dark secret of her own : due to a spell cast upon her years ago , she transforms into an ogre by night . in this storyline , fiona must learn to hold acceptance for herself , and she must realize what beauty truly means : to simply act as one \\' s self . upon fiona \\' s learning of shrek \\' s desire to pursue a relationship with her , fiona , knowing that acceptance of herself serves as the only platform for her love with shrek to work , gives in to her inner demons of self - ridicule and hatred . any child can pull from fiona \\' s transformation the meaning of beauty and the meaning of self - acceptance . on the technical side , shrek triumphs . directors adam adamson and vicky jenson pace shrek in a consistent and satisfying manner , evenly distributing the lessons learned by the central characters . these central characters spring to life thanks to brilliant voice work from mike myers ( shrek ) , eddie murphy ( donkey ) , and cameron diaz ( princess fiona ) . myers creates his shrek as a lovable and troubled ogre whose green color not only serves as a skin color but perhaps his envy of other , \" normal \" beings . murphy succeeds with his donkey through recreating the high - strung persona that so many know the actor to have off screen . cameron diaz exudes charisma and innocence as fiona , giving the princess / ogre a sense of power that many female characters in animated films lack . while the direction and voice work certainly elevate shrek , the ultimate factor in the film succeeding lies in the screenplay , written by ted elliott , terry rossio , joe stillman , and roger s . h . schulman . the script never underestimates the intelligence of the viewer , combining the three previously spoken of elements with humor for adults and children alike . capping it off with a constant tongue - in - cheek feel that pokes fun at classic disney animated features , the fresh and entertaining screenplay delivers . with shrek , dreamworks executive jeffrey katzenberg has certainly one - upped himself by creating an instant animated classic that will live on for ages to come . the smaller children will laugh and cheer ; the adults will laugh even harder and leave understanding much that their children did not . a film that breaks stereotypes and creates a definite standard of its own , shrek can certainly endure as one for the ages .',\n",

              " ('the sweet hereafter could serve as a textbook example of the difference between television movies and \" real \" movies . consider for a moment what a television producer would do with a book that features a fatal school bus accident and a lawyer out to sign up the bereaved -- lots of hot sensationalism interrupted with breaks to sell beer and toothpaste . top - flight writer and director atom egoyan delivers instead a film with tremendous power whose most notable trait is its touching subtlety . based on a respected book of the same name by author russell banks , the movie represents a rethinking of the story \\' s structure , not merely a literal adaptation of the novel . told in linear form by four narrators in the book , egoyan \\' s version happens instead in overlapping time sequences and without a narrator . the author is even on record as applauding egoyan \\' s changes . in the press notes the book \\' s author describes the story as \" a parable of lost children . \" he says it asks what a town does in the absence of its children . picking up on this , egoyan has a flashback in which a sitter , nicole burnell , played with grace by sarah polley , reads parts of \" the pied piper \" from an old , illustrated book to her two charges . periodically throughout the picture , nicole \\' s readings are heard in voice - over . you have never heard this moving poem read so sweetly or in such an appropriate moment . they and the rest of the town \\' s children come into harm \\' s way -- some live and others are seriously injured . and the entire small canadian town where the accident occurs is never the same again . although the physical damage is inflicted mainly on the children , the adults bear the emotional scars of the loss . ian holm , in arguably the best performance of his distinguished career , plays mitchell stephens , an intense man of quiet misery . mitchell is the outsider in the story set in a small , snow - encrusted community in the british columbian wilderness . his mission there is a singular one , to sign up the parents so that he can sue someone , anyone , on their behalf . if this seems crass , well it is , but mitchell approaches his job with the dedication of a religious zealot . the story unfolds slowly and always believably . each little aspect has its own fascination . as mitchell interviews wendell and rita walker , played with quiet realism by maury chaykin and alberta watson , he has a simple task . he wants them to suggest some model couple in the village who has a lost a child so that he can use that couple to form the basis of the suit . wendell ticks off one town member after another and then , as one can in a small town , enumerates each person \\' s numerous faults . although the town is no peyton place , people there do have their foibles . one of the best parents in the town appears to be billy ansell ( bruce greenwood ) , who rides his pickup behind the school bus everyday just so he can wave good - bye to his kids . well , single parent billy \\' s fault is that he has regularly scheduled trysts with the married rita . his confessions to rita about his feelings of loss are one of the many heartfelt outpourings in the story . the accident itself , a simple one of a bus hitting a patch of ice , isn \\' t shown until the middle of the picture , but , nevertheless , the mystery about it builds throughout the film . although the picture is no detective story , finding out exactly what happened is a subtheme in a movie that is primarily a character study of a town gripped by tragedy . as the injured bus driver , gabrielle rose , dolores driscoll plays the role of a dedicated individual who loves kids with a passion and for whom the tragedy takes on special meaning . to round out the story , mitchell has his own private tragedy to bear . his daughter zoe ( caerthan banks ) is a drug addict who has bounced in and out of one half - way house and recovery center after another . fond of calling her dad on his cell phone so she can ask for money or help , she interrupts him at many emotionally charged moments as he attempts to sign up the townsfolk . ( \" i can help you , \" mitchell tries to reassure billy . \" not unless you can raise the dead , \" billy snaps back . mitchell \\' s pitch is never an easy one and worrying about zoe only makes it harder . ) mychael danna \\' s haunting music sets the stage for tragedy . the cinematography by paul sarossy is sweeping in its outdoor grandeur , but it is in the warm , shadowy , intimate moments indoors where it works best . the show , which is ripe for emotional manipulation , never plays with its audience . still , when the house lights go up , you may feel as i did . i could barely breathe ; i was so overcome by the sum total of what i had witnessed . more than anything , the film is like a master painting . each cinematic brush stroke is carefully laid down by egoyan with the beauty building with each dollop of paint . with the final color in place , the masterpiece is complete , and the ending credits roll . the sweet hereafter runs 1 : 50 . it is rated r for mature themes , sexuality and some profanity and would be fine teenagers .',\n",

( although i would like to have seen colm meaney in a white star uniform , or even as the ill - fated engineer . ) the love story itself is rather conventional . i think some reviewers found it weak , and that may be a fair criticism . the performances are the key here . zane has the meatiest part in the movie , and he plays the arrogant , condescending steel millionaire to the hilt . he \\' s smooth , he looks great in a tuxedo , and he \\' s a convincing enough jerk that the winslet - dicaprio relationship looks plausible . at the moment when he sees a little girl too frightened to get aboard a lifeboat , you can hear the wheels in his mind turning , saying not \" can i save this little girl ? \" , but \" can she help me get on a lifeboat ? \" dicaprio is a revelation . i hadn \\' t seen him before in anything , and didn \\' t know what the heck to expect , really . ( honestly , i expected a bad irish accent , but cameron evidently decided that was a bad idea , so dicaprio plays a poor american artist who wins a ticket in a poker game . ) dicaprio exhibits an infectious joy at being alive , and being on the titanic , that it \\' s hard not to like him . from the moment that the ship leaves port until it hits the iceberg , dicaprio has to carry the movie and keep our interest , and he never falters . winslet \\' s character grows up a lot during the movie , and so does her performance . at first , she \\' s not required to do anything but wear period clothing and look drop - dead gorgeous . we know from the narration that she \\' s monstrously unhappy with her arranged marriage to zane , but there isn \\' t any expression of these feelings until she encounters dicaprio . winslet and dicaprio develop a chemistry that manages to propel the movie along until the ship hits the iceberg . it \\' s at that moment where winslet \\' s character really comes alive . faced with real danger , she drops her spoiled - rich - girl mannerisms and does a splendid job . as rose and jack race around the doomed ship , looking for shelter from the freezing water and cal \\' s fiery temper , winslet turns in a superb acting performance , mixing courage and compassion and anger with sheer shrieking terror . of course , the most interesting character is the ship itself . cameron has clearly fallen in love with titanic , and shows her in every mood -- as a deserted wreck , down in the boiler room , up on the bridge , down in the hold , at the captain \\' s table , down in steerage -- and manages to bring the great ship back from the dead . cameron \\' s greatest gift is that he allows us to fall in love with titanic as well .',\n",

( personal side note : i saw this movie on the road during a houston business trip . for whatever reason , my hotel ' s cable system wasn ' t showing the astros - braves game , which featured a randy johnson - greg maddux matchup . this forced me to pay full price for snake eyes instead of watching a perfectly good baseball game for free -- so the invective , deserved as it is , should be seen in that perspective . ) snake eyes is supposed to be a mystery movie , and good mystery movies are supposed to leave you asking yourself questions on the way out of theater . snake eyes is not a good mystery movie , but i had some questions : where ' s the manager , and how do i get a re - admit pass ? if i fall asleep on the drive home and wreck my rent - a - car , can i sue brian de palma ? is it too late for the academy to revoke nicolas cage ' s oscar ? will someone please ( i ' m begging you ) give gary sinise a role worthy of his talents ? and how , exactly does cage end up wearing the exact same shirt and tie as sinise does ? the first and most glaringly wrong thing with snake eyes is the trailer . if you ' ve seen the trailer without seeing the movie , consider yourself fortunate . the trailer is a work of sheer genius . it manages to convey everything worthy of the movie -- the noteworthy steadicam work , the exuberance of cage ' s performance as a thoroughly corrupt atlantic city policeman , the essential elements of the marginal plot . the expert craftsman who pieced together a fairly good trailer out of snippets of a wretched movie deserves praise and a percentage of the gross . ( is a best trailer category at the oscars that far - fetched , after all ? ) but all it does is set us up for an overwhelmingly disappointing movie . the trailer sets up what should have been a promising plot : detective ricky santoro ( cage ) must solve the mystery of who shot the secretary of defense at an atlantic city pay - per - view boxing match . unfortunately , there are multiple problems afoot . the trailer gives away much , too much of the story . the shooter is killed instantly , so the story revolves around why the secretary was killed and who is involved in the conspiracy . the film ' s secret is ho - hum at best , and anyone who has watched the trailer and is aware of the law of economy of characters can figure out who the top conspirator is . without an interesting plot , without interesting dialogue , and without much of a reason to care about the characters or the story , snake eyes is a failure on almost every possible level . as much as i hated this movie , i must give brian de palma one tiny bit of credit . de palma is maddeningly inconsistent . he can , on his day , create amazingly well - done movies ( the untouchables , carlito ' s way ) . on off - days , he can be , well , just horrid ( the bonfire of the vanities , raising cain ) . snake eyes falls into the horrid category , but there are a couple of moments that are worth seeing strictly for their film - school degree - of - difficulty value . the steadicam opening scene does a good job of introducing the cage character and is a virtuoso technical job by both the director and the actor . there is a split - screen chase scene that looks pretty good , and it ' s followed by a god ' s eye view of a bank of hotel rooms that ' s imaginitively done . this is what ' s called giving the devil his due . but the technical skill doesn ' t even come close to making up for the sheer evil of this movie . placing plot holes to one side for a moment , snake eyes features easily the worst boxing match in cinema history ( george foreman is in better shape than the movie boxers ) , a hurricane that exists for no other reason than to punctuate significant plotlines with portentuous thunderclaps , and perhaps the worst , most overly drawn out ending in years . snake eyes is a criminal act , an evil waste of time and talent . cage , sinise , and yes , even de palma deserve better . the audience deserves better -- but no refund , no re - admit pass , no free popcorn coupon , can ever restore to us the time we ' ve spent or wash the awful images from our mind . however , we are left with one consolation , that we were warned by the movie ' s title -- because snake eyes is nothing more than a roll of craps .\",\n",

( cheers ) crimes ( boos ) \\' . \" what is a sex crime ? \" ray asks . \" not gettin \\' any ! \" one student responds . this pretty much sets the tone of the film we are about to watch . however , upon hearing this , one student , suzie toller ( neve campbell ) , stands up and leaves the room , commenting that they can both kiss part of her body . and so , wild things sets into motion . quickly , kelly begins hitting on sam , but sam doesn \\' t want anything to do with her advances . kelly is stubborn and continues to pursue him . she even pleads with him to let her wash his jeep . surprisingly , that \\' s really all i can tell you about the plot . any more would give away one of the many crucial plot twists . and what \\' s more , these plot twists are actually unpredictable . going along the way of scream , wild things maintains that film \\' s surprises , and then adds even more to them . there are more plot twists in this film than probably any i have ever seen . and even though you think you may get tired of them , the surprises are so genuine that it \\' s rather pleasing . going back over them in my mind , nearly all of them work , though some stretch the boundaries of belief . thankfully , the convoluted plot doesn \\' t give us much time to think about each one , pouncing yet another twist on us before the shock of the previous one has worn off . as for the critics who complain that the film is trashy -- well , it is . this is pretty much just one trashy film . however , it is the kind of trashy that isn \\' t hard to watch . it \\' s good trash , in a sense . one , the screenplay knows that it \\' s not to be taken seriously , and it includes a lot of humor and satire into the story . this varies everywhere from kelly \\' s mother ( theresa russell ) , who is more of a caricature of rich people , all the way to an ambulance - chasing lawyer ( bill murray ) , who wears a neck - brace to cover an insurance scam he is running . bill murray also provides the best character in the film , and most of the genuine laughs . and two , the sex is more than gratuitous , although not unwelcomed . wild things is supposed to have sex in it ( what film with that title wouldn \\' t ? ) , and this movie breaks the boundaries . instead of having heterosexual sex scenes , it also includes lesbian scenes between denise richards and neve campbell ( don \\' t worry . . . it \\' s not as graphic as you might think ) . the heterosexual scenes are quite graphic , but the surprise shocker is kevin bacon \\' s full - frontal nude scene . it \\' s very brief , so if you blink , you may miss ( ahem ) it . and , for as long as i can remember , i don \\' t think i have seen an r - rated film show an erect one before ( it \\' s not completely , but judging from the audiences \\' reaction , it was more than they expected too ) . also , during one scene late in the film , there seemed to be a relationship brewing between bacon and dillon \\' s characters , but nothing came of it ( makes you wonder if the director had to cut it in order for the r rating , or if the actors refused to do it ) . what first made me want to see wild things was its cast . neve campbell , of course , has been one of my favorite actresses since the scream films were released . here , however , she turns every typical role she has done on its head and plays a gothic pothead . the closest role to this was her performance in the craft ( though even in that she was a nice girl ) . campbell is probably the best in the film and shows her wide range of talent . you can tell she will be around for a long time . denise richards will also be around for a long time , although she may be limited to the roles without much range . here , she gets to express more emotions than in her stiff ( yet effective ) performance in starship troopers . hopefully one day she will land a very good role that can display her ability . and then there is daphne rubin - vega , a newcomer to the movies . she gives a very good performance , although her character is mostly left to the background for the first hour and a half . towards the end she does get a bigger part . on the male side , matt dillon is probably the best , giving a subtle performance that surprises with every twist . kevin bacon has a slightly wooden character , but he makes the most of it . you must have admiration , though , for what he did on screen . and judging from many of the women \\' s reactions in the theater to that shot , they have grown a deeper appreciation for bacon ( yeah , right ) . and then there is bill murray . his performance is the comic relief , and he nearly steals the film . as a whole , the entire cast works wondrously together , and they seem at home , even when doing the menage a troi . director john mcnaughton , who has previously done the critically acclaimed henry : portrait of a serial killer , has constructed a wonderfully twisty plot that works . his direction is smooth and stylish . the visuals are striking , filled with rich colors , and almost so realistic that we can actually breathe the humidity in the air . however , he seems more at home when the actors aren \\' t talking . his fly - by shots of the swampy areas are brilliant , and his photography of denise richards \\' climbing out of the pool is a highlight . the cinematography is gorgeous in its details . its not often that you see a film like this , and we should watch it just to see how the camera can take pictures . then , there is the music . this was probably the most obvious thing to me , as it set the perfect mood for the film . it \\' s hard to describe in words , so just see the film and listen to it . it \\' s wonderfully composed and presented . and be sure to stick around during the closing credits ! mcnaughton has finally put the ending credits to good use ( while most comedies use it for outtakes ) . he has included some small scenes which help explain the preceding events . some may say that these are lame attempts to explain the convoluted plot , but it \\' s an entertaining way to finish the film . plus , there are some shocking moments in these ending credits which just add to the fun . wild things is appropriately rated r for strong sexuality , nudity , language and violence . again , the nudity is rather unnecessary , but let \\' s face it -- people want to see it . so why not give it to them ? neve campbell , admirably , has a no - nudity clause in her contract , and the most you see of her is from behind as she takes her top off ( way to go , neve ! ) . the sex scenes are graphic , especially the first one we see , between the mother and one of her deck hands . one almost wonders how they got away with the r rating . the language is quite harsh too , ranging from sexual innuendo to your average , everyday profanity . and i can \\' t stress it enough : don \\' t allow kids under 18 to see this film . the target age for the movie is the 18 - 24 range , and that \\' s who should see it . it \\' s definitely not for those under 18 ! did i mention that this film is rated r ? however , for those that do get a chance to watch it , you will probably more likely be pleased , and may even take friends to see it the next time .',\n",

time playwright richard o \\' brien decided he wanted to make a musical homage to the crazy b - movies he had grown up with as a child , set to a bunch of catchy rock tunes of his own design . the result was the stage play the rocky horror show , which opened to fairly decent reviews in london in 1973 and was even hailed the best musical of 1973 by prominent drama critics in england . the play was so successful that the film rights were immediately snapped up and production on the film began a mere year later , in october of 1974 . the film version ( now titled the rocky horror picture show ) was released in 1975 . . . and immediately tanked at the box office . whether it was because fox wasn \\' t quite sure how to market it to audiences or that audiences didn \\' t quite know what to make of it themselves has never really been determined , but the one common bit of knowledge about the film was that it was a huge flop . it seemed that the infectious spirit brought about by the stage version had not been infused into the film version and fox quickly had it pulled from theaters . a year later , something entirely strange and magical happened . prints of the film started to be distributed to theaters in small amounts and were circulating at midnight shows across the country , and it was then that a whole new audience found the film . this new audience was prone to dressing up like the characters from the film , acting out segments in front of the screen as the movie played , yelling rude comments at the screen , and just generally having a good time . word quickly spread about this new phenomena of interactive film and the rocky horror picture show \\' s life as the ultimate cult film was born . for the virgins out there who are unaware , the plot centers around a loving couple , brad majors ( barry bostwick ) and janet weiss ( susan sarandon ) , who come from a small town called denton . brad and janet have just attended the wedding of two of their friends and decide that they also want to be wed . they plan a trip to see the man who led to their meeting , dr . everett scott ( jonathan adams , who played the narrator in the original stage version ) , but their car gets a flat on the way to his home . remembering a castle they had seen back a few miles down the road , they decide to walk there and see if the residents have a phone they might be able to use to call for assistance . the castle is actually the home of a race of aliens from the planet transsexual ( in the galaxy of transylvania ) , who are lead by the eccentric fishnet - stocking wearing mad scientist dr . frank - n - furter ( tim curry ) . frank - n - furter has masterminded the secret to creating life and has done so in the form of rocky ( peter hinwood ) . as rocky becomes accustomed to his new environment , brad and janet find themselves at the mercy of frank - n - furter \\' s mad schemes . little do any of them know that the doctor \\' s handyman , riff - raff ( original author richard o \\' brien ) , and domestic , magenta ( patricia quinn ) , are actually transsexual planetary protectors who have been sent to stop frank from spreading his alien evil all over the earth . going back and revisiting this film after ten years ( 1990 being the first time i had ever seen it ) , it is amazing to me that this film ever got made or has had the staying power that it has . if i had been a fox executive around the time of its release , i don \\' t think i would have known what to make of it either . for all intents and purposes it is a bad movie ( though bad in a really good sort of way ) , but sumptuous production design and a great deal of incredibly catchy songs really help to increase the likability of the film . by the time the credits role , it is fairly easy to have gotten wrapped up in the film and its characters , and one really gets the feeling that richard o \\' brien definitely was a fan of the old cheesy b - movies his film is based on . when i say that the wall - to - wall songs are catchy what i really mean to say is that , once you hear them , they will be ingrained in your head for all of eternity . it goes without saying that the \" time warp \" is the most popular song in the film . even people who have never seen the movie know of that particular song . what those who haven \\' t seen the movie don \\' t know though , is that there are even more songs in the film that are just as worthy of acknowledgment . my personal favorite is \" over at the frankenstein place \" , but \" dammit janet \" is also maddeningly catchy . tim curry \\' s vocals on the rocking tune \" sweet transvestite \" need to be heard to be believed . the finale of the film , a big floor show staged by frank - n - furter and featuring most of the cast in garters and fishnets ( including barry bostwick . . . frightening ! ) , features no less than four songs ( \" rose tint my world \" , \" don \\' t dream it \" , \" wild and untamed thing \" , and \" i \\' m going home \" ) , all of which are immensely singable . the film \\' s true popularity and longevity resides in its audience participation though . despite the catchiness of the songs , this movie would have been long forgotten about if it hadn \\' t have been for the multitude of folks who dress up every friday or saturday night to rush out and be a part of their own little floor show . watching this film at home is nothing compared to actually experiencing this in a theater with hundreds of rabid fans ( unless you don \\' t mind inviting friends over and letting them shoot water guns in your home or letting them throw rice and pieces of toast all over the place ) . note : director jim sharman brought back to the central characters of the film , in the form of a sequel , resulting in the very much forgotten film shock treatment , which picks up with brad and janet ( this time played by cliff de young and jessica harper ! ) as contestants on a game show in their home town of denton . the two are menaced by the evil tv station manager ( also played by de young ) , who wishes to claim janet as his own . o \\' brien returned as a writer / performer on the project ( as did quinn , campbell , and gray in performance capacity only ) , but the film had nowhere near the spirit of the original . 25 years later , this film is still the pinnacle of cult filmdom and is continuously screened at midnight all over the world . as a lasting testament to the longevity of the film and its legion of fans , a brand new special edition 2 - disc dvd set has been released that is the most comprehensive compendium of rocky horror to date ( even out shining the laserdisc special edition that was released for its 20th anniversary ) . if you are one of those people who can \\' t get enough of the film , this disc should be more than enough to satisfy your appetites . in an attempt to recreate the interactivity of the film , fox home entertainment has released this wonderful 2 - disc dvd set loaded with so many extras that it \\' ll take a good eight hours just to take in the majority of it all . the film itself is located on the first disc and has been given a beautiful transfer that shows it in its original aspect ratio of 1 . 85 : 1 ( enhanced for 16x9 televisions ) . the film is presented in two different versions , the us theatrical version and the uk version which adds a musical number during the finale called \" superheroes \" . for ambitious viewers , the disc also includes a hidden version ( located on the main menu by clicking left from the scene selection menu choice and highlighting a pair of lips in the lower left corner ) which presents the film in the manner it was originally supposed to have been seen . originally , the film was to have been similar to the wizard of oz , with the first half of the it seen in black and white ( and not changing to color until the transylvanians are first revealed to brad and janet during the time warp musical number ) . most reports , including a documentary on the disc , say that the color was supposed to appear when frank - n - furter first shows up in the elevator , but it does seem to work better where it was placed on this version , depicting the vast difference between the world brad and janet were used to compared with the one to which they are introduced . the film contains a commentary track by show creator ( and faithful handyman ) richard o \\' brien and co - star patricia quinn which is fairly enjoyable ( and quinn immediately starts off by refusing to speak about sarandon nearly contracting pneumonia while having to walk around wet and half - naked on freezing cold sets , which she apparently complained about the entire film and in future interviews ) . the two seem like old friends and have great stories to tell , but they also point out cast members that are sadly no longer with us anymore ( and there are quite a few ) . fox has also tried to recreate the feel of attending the film in a theater with several audience participation segments . the first feature ( and the most simple ) is a subtitle prompter which lets you know when to open up on people with your water guns or when the right time to throw your toast is . the second feature is an audience participation track , which lets you in on what you might hear on a good night out at the show . most of the comments are unintelligible because it is basically just a large group of people screaming their heads off , but every once and a while a comment can be heard that will invoke a bit of laughter . the final participation segment uses a technology very much like the technology used on the matrix dvd , where a pair of lips will appear on - screen during certain scenes of the film ( mostly during the musical numbers ) that can be selected by pressing enter on your remote . when selected , you will be taken out of the film and into a live participation version of the scene put on during one of the many screenings that occur all over the world . once the segment is over , you are deposited right back into the film where you left off . the first disc also contains a few dvd - rom goodies for those with that particular type of dvd player . there is a timeline of the evolution from the stage play version to worldwide cult sensation , a video jukebox , a you don \\' t know jack - styled trivia game ( which is about as bare bones a you don \\' t know jack parody as it can be ) , and a bizarre mad - libs styled word game known as riff - raff \\' s story lab . links to the rocky horror websites are also available from the dvd - rom portion of the disc . the second disc features even more goodies for the person who loves extras . former lite - rock video channel turned music historians vh - 1 have allowed some of their outtake footage from the \" behind the music : rocky horror \" special that they ran earlier in the year to be shown here , as well as a pop - up video for the meat loaf - sung \" hot patootie \" . the \" behind the music \" segments are all very interesting , especially richard o \\' brien \\' s jaunt through the castle ( which is now a hotel ! ) where the film was originally shot . there are also extensions of the sarandon , bostwick , quinn , o \\' brien , and meat loaf interviews . as far as extras for the film itself go , there are two deleted musical numbers that are also included here . one of which is just the \" superheroes \" number available in the uk version , but there is also another rare musical number presented here called \" once in a while \" . a series of alternate takes are also presented here , but none of them are really much of a revelation ( except for the undressing scene in which we see that patricia quinn is having a hard time unbuttoning barry bostwick \\' s pants ) . for the completist who must have every little bit of rocky horror paraphernalia , a misprinted end sequence and alternate credit sequence are also presented here . rounding out the disc is a decent documentary called rocky horror double feature video show , two theatrical trailers ( proclaiming that the film is \" a different sort of jaws \" ) , a still gallery , and two sing - a - longs ( for \" toucha toucha touch me \" and \" sweet transvestite \" ) . fox \\' s special edition is the dvd set that rocky horror fans have been waiting for all their lives ( \" you \\' re lucky . . . i \\' m lucky . . . he \\' s lucky . . . we \\' re all lucky ! \" ) . it \\' s not just amazing enough that tons of classic italian films are finally getting their recognition in the u . s . , but even long standing traditions are finally receiving their due on the wonderful dvd format . as with their excellent dvds of the abyss , fight club , independence day , and the sound of music , fox shows that they have most certainly made the commitment to provide the things that dvd lovers want . i raise a toast to them ( cue the throwing of the bread ) as i cut out the lights , sit back , and watch those disembodied lips begin to sing about b - movie tradition .

              " ('i suppose an argument could be made that toy story is one of those films that didn \\' t need a sequel . beloved by kids and their parents , respected equally by mainstream america and geekish movie buffs , that first movie remains a landmark of recent history , the one that burst open the possibilities of computer animation and demonstrated through wild invention and giddy chutzpah just how complacent the disney animation machine had become in cranking out fluffy razzle - dazzle entertainment full of formula storytelling and banal songwriting . if disney was embarrassed at being beaten at its own game ( toy story was a smash hit of unexpected proportions , and one that caught the merchandising end of the business unaware as demand for action figures far outstripped supply ) , it didn \\' t show , and as distributor and part - owner of the property , at least it had a piece of the action . toy story 2 was greenlighted as a direct - to - video project , disney \\' s standard tactic for milking a few more bucks out of hot franchises without expending the effort of developing a proper feature film . as someone who doesn \\' t believe sequels are necessarily a bad thing ( granted , they usually are a bad thing , but that \\' s because they \\' re made for the wrong reasons ) , i had to wonder what in the world they were thinking . fortunately , disney claimed to have been so knocked - out by early animation tests that they let pixar go full - speed ahead with a theatrical sequel . lucky thing , too -- like the first movie , this one is a joy to behold on the big screen , and technically , it improves on its predecessor on just about every level . ( from a business standpoint , the end credits show that the new creations are copyrighted by pixar , while the previous film \\' s elements are shared between pixar and disney , a sign of the production house \\' s new cachet in hollywood . ) visually , the main shortcoming of this fully computer - generated movie is that human figures are still rendered relatively poorly , making them look a little creepy . fortunately , that eerie unreality fits in perfectly with the perspective of the movie , where the secret world of toys is more immediate , and arguably more attractive , than the world of the humans who surround them . as before , the story is predicated on the premise that the toys scattered around the bedroom of a little boy named andy -- and , indeed , all the toys scattered around the bedrooms of all little children -- come to life in the child \\' s absence . while the toys scamper about and chatter endlessly among themselves , the real joy of a toy \\' s life is to mean something to its owner . one of the subjects of this new film is the sadness of toys that have been broken or abandoned , left on a shelf to gather dust , and another is the sort of emotional limbo inhabited by toys that are mere prizes of covetous collectors . most often , those toys are packed away in dark spaces , safe from sunlight and humidity , and often they \\' re not even removed from their packaging . imagine what a chip that would put on your shoulder , and you \\' ll understand the attitudes of the collector \\' s items that show up in this movie . sheriff woody ( voiced by a note - perfect tom hanks ) , the longtime favorite among andy \\' s toys who was challenged in the previous go - round by the arrival of flashy - new - thing action figure buzz lightyear ( tim allen ) , suffers an injury early in the film , when andy tugs too hard on his arm and pulls a seam apart , revealing the stuffing inside . this accident catalyzes some uneasieness among the toys , who know too well that a broken toy is often a forgotten toy , and a forgotten toy is one that loses its reason for existence . those anxieties are crystallized when andy \\' s mom tears through his living room , collecting old toys for a yard sale . and there \\' s an ironic twist to the tale , as woody winds up being stolen by an avid toy collector who needs exactly that quaint cowboy figure to complete a set that he hopes to sell to a japanese toy museum for a sizable sum . the rest of andy \\' s toys , who owe him quite a debt , resolve to rescue him . that this film manages to turn a box marked \" 25 cents \" into a symbol of doom , or to make its screed against the retention of collectible toys by wrongheaded profiteers fuel for a metaphysical dilemma , is a testament to its skill at metaphor , seamlessly translating the hopes and fears of our real world into that of the toys . operating on this level of abstraction , toy story 2 tackles some mighty heavy issues without once preaching or veering into pretentiousness . ( the worst i can say is that randy newman seems to have reserved his sappiest lyric in years for sarah mclachlan , who stops the movie cold by singing it at just about the halfway mark . ) sometimes i think toy story 2 tries too hard . there \\' s somewhat less of the seat - of - the - pants loopiness that energized the first film , allowing it to surprise and excite on a near - constant basis , and more philosophizing about toys , collectors , the nature of happiness and the meaning of life . while that leads to fewer bellylaughs , it does make way for more elaborate humor and an uncommonly ambitious reflexivity that asks the toys to consider their own status as commodities that move in and out of fashion . ( just don \\' t ask why andy \\' s favorite toy is based on a tv series that was canceled in 1957 . ) where else in mainstream movies do you get such an awesome moment as the one where buzz arrives at al \\' s toy barn to find it stocked to the gills with his doppelgangers , buzz lightyear action figures ? forget the self - congratulatory science fiction of the matrix -- this is a fundamental mind - bender for buzz , and the audience shares his humility and wonderment at the sight . here , as in the roughly concurrent scene where woody watches tapes of the howdy doodyish children \\' s tv show that originated his character , we see our protagonists come face - to - face with god . in sly ways , then , toy story 2 can be read as a film about mortality , a metaphorical consideration of aging and death . significantly , the film \\' s very first sequence concludes with a grim shocker that had our opening - night crowd in a near - uproar . and toward the end , when buzz and woody speculate on how long they have before andy grows up and discards his old toys , one of them observes , with an alacrity both inspirational and heartbreaking , that it will be fun while it lasts . so toy story 2 joins the tradition of children \\' s stories , largely neglected of late , that say something real about the inevitable joys and tragedies of existence . what \\' s really striking is that both toy story films ( and , to a lesser degree , pixar \\' s a bug \\' s life ) are kids \\' movies with wit and sophistication to shame most of their ostensibly adult counterparts , not to mention whatever piece of tot - friendly eye - candy is due from the disney dream factory any given summer . it puts one in mind of the glory days of chuck jones and the old gang at warner bros . animation . i \\' m not sure lasseter and his pals at pixar will ever operate at quite that level of purely visual invention -- they love traditional narrative too much -- but , boy , it makes me wonder what they might come up with next . -------------------------------------------------------------- directed by john lasseter , colin brady , ash brannon , and lee unkrich written by lasseter , brannon , peter docter , andrew stanton , rita hsaio , doug chamberlain , and chris webb cinematography by sharon calahan starring ( voices ) tom hanks , tim allen , and joan cusack usa , 1999 theatrical aspect ratio : 1 . 85 : 1 --------------------------------------------------------------',\n",

              " ('in the wake of the smashing success of \" rumble in the bronx , \" it \\' s looking more and more likely that more jackie chan films will see american release . rumor has it that one of these films will be drunken master ii . the version i have is a copy from the laserdisc ; it \\' s widescreen and bilingually - subtitled , as are most hong kong films these days . availability over here in the united states is very limited ; these films must either be purchased via pirates or sought out from asian distributors such as tai seng . the subtitling on the copy i have is slightly hard to read ; the letters are white and a bit small . although the american release will almost certainly be dubbed , this review is of the subtitled version , so please keep that in mind if you \\' re reading this review to help you decide whether to go out and see it . to be fair , i must admit that i \\' ve never been very fond of \" period - piece \" martial arts movies -- the ones set in some nebulous china of the distant or not so distant past . perhaps it \\' s because most of those i \\' ve seen were filmed on inferior stock , with either butchered dubbing or all - but - illegible subtitling , or perhaps it \\' s because their plots all tend to be very similar to each other and , in many cases , all but nonexistant . in fact , many of them get so wrapped up in their subplots that they seem to forget their main plot entirely until only a few minutes before the end . or , for that matter , it might be because the jackie chan films with more modern settings ( armour of god , rumble in the bronx , etc . ) tend to have more spectacular stunts , often involving large motor vehicles and large explosions , whereas period pieces simply have the martial arts . having said that , i must now turn right around and say that drunken master ii is a remarkable exception to all or most of the above , is one of the better martial arts films i \\' ve seen , and i quite enjoyed it . surprised ? well , so was i . drunken master ii is about a young man named wong fei - hong ( played by jackie chan ) who is a master of the drunken boxing style of kung fu . where he learned this style is uncertain , as his father , wong kei - ying ( ti lung ) is steadfast in his opposition to fei - hong \\' s practicing it rather than some more normal style of kung fu . apparently , fei - hong is some sort of figure from chinese folklore , rather like paul bunyan is for americans , but i \\' ve heard very little about this , and could quite well be wrong , so i \\' ll leave analysis of that to the people who know it better . one of my friends points out that the character of wong fei - hong is also featured in the \" once upon a time in china \" movies , but i have not yet seen those . the plot of drunken master ii is somewhat hazy , as are the plots to many such films , but if you \\' re watching a jackie chan film , odds are you aren \\' t expecting something on the order of \" war and peace \" . the story seems to revolve around those evil foreigners who are spiriting away ancient chinese relics ( and hence , china \\' s cultural heritage ) while overworking , underpaying , and beating up chinese workers in a nearby steel mill . however , this plot merely serves as a framework for the other main story of the film -- fei - hong \\' s perpetual struggle to win his girlfriend , supplicate his father , keep his ( pregnant ) mother ( played by anita mui ) from fighting , and keep from getting beaten up by evil foreigner thugs . the macguffin that drives the plot ( s ) is a precious antique jade imperial seal which is being taken away by the evil foreigners . in the beginning , fei - hong accidentally steals it while trying to recover an identically - wrapped box containing the medicinal ginseng his father was bringing back for a customer . in the process , he clashes with another thief , who is himself trying for the seal but ends up instead with the ginseng . after fei - hong narrowly avoids getting caught with the seal by the evil foreigners \\' lackies , thanks to some timely intervention by a general \\' s son ( a cameo appearance by andy lau , who would later take on the starring role in drunken master iii ! ) , comedic chaos ensues back at the wong household when fei - hong and his mother attempt to come up with a replacement for the missing ginseng . and so it goes . and the plot thickens later on , such as when fei - hong \\' s girlfriend maneuvers him into a kung fu match with a rival , or when fei - hong and the thief , now revealed to be a loyalist manchu officer trying to recover the seal and stop the evil foreigners , are attacked en masse ( another grand kung - fu movie tradition ) , but i think i \\' ve already spent more time on the plot than it really deserves . let \\' s move on to the real draw of jackie chan movies . . . the action . there \\' s plenty of martial arts action to be found in this movie . . . of course , in a kung fu film , that \\' s to be expected . however , this isn \\' t just another kung fu movie ; this one has jackie chan doing the fight and stunt choreography , and jackie chan is a genius . the primary martial arts \" style \" featured in the film is drunken boxing , a form of kung fu which attempts to draw the adversary off his guard by making it seem like the fellow using it is drunk . further , for the purposes of this film at least , drunken boxers fight better when they actually _are_ intoxicated . . . but there \\' s a fine line between just drunk enough and drunk into a stupor . under normal circumstances , the idea of someone staggering around looking sloshed but managing to fight effectively and even incredibly might seem rather stupid , but jackie pulls it off with flair . the kung fu sequences are so intricate in their staging and execution that it is pointless to try to describe it on paper , so i \\' ll just say that the fights -- especially the big climactic fight at the end -- in themselves make the movie worth watching . another thing drunken master ii has going for it is the stunt work . even without motor vehicles ( well , not counting a train ) , there are some remarkable stunts in this film . among other things , jackie dives off a balcony into a table and crawls across hot coals ( not once , but at _least_ twice , if you count the outtake shown during the credits ) . ( quicktime movies of these stunts can be found through the www movie database . ) unlike in american films , these stunts are _not_ faked . drunken master ii stars several veteran actors of the hong kong movie scene , including jackie , ti lung ( \" a better tomorrow \" 1 & 2 ) , and anita mui ( the \" heroic trio \" series , \" rumble in the bronx \" ) . the performances are first - rate , especially when it comes to the comedy parts of the film . the scene where fei - hong and his mother conspire literally behind fei - hong \\' s father \\' s back to cover up for the missing ginseng root is hilarious , as is the scene where fei - hong \\' s mother , having just revealed that she is pregnant , is threatening to hurt herself ( in order to draw her husband \\' s anger away from fei - hong ) . jackie has developed his knack for physical comedy into a sort of mastery over the years , and he \\' s in fine form all through drunken master ii . as far as cinematography is concerned , it certainly works for this film . it \\' s nothing spectacular , but is at least a dozen times better than all those old kung fu movies of the 70s . the picture is crisp and clear . one thing i find particularly worthy of mention is that , at least in the copy i have , the screen was wider than any film i \\' ve ever seen on videotape before -- almost a whole 1 / 3 of the screen was blocked out above and below . ( watch this on a bigscreen tv or movie theater if you can . ) it will be an utter shame if this film is eventually pan - and - scanned for american video release . drunken master ii shows the full potential of \" period piece \" kung fu movies , and it \\' s good enough to overcome even my usual distaste for such movies . the plot does meander a bit , but that \\' s to be expected in this type of film . if you like this kind of movie , you \\' ll love this movie , and if not , well , give it a chance anyway . if nothing else , the martial arts and stunt sequences are by themselves worth the price of admission or rental .',\n",

              " ('i came to an epiphany while watching the bachelor , an innocuous - enough - on - the - surface romantic comedy . it \\' s not the sort of film in which one would expect to achieve any moment of clarity , but there it was nonetheless . i sat there watching this marshmallow of a movie unfold when suddenly i realized what is so ridiculously wrong with the entire romantic comedy genre circa 1999 . in a word , it \\' s the same thing that \\' s wrong with so many movies circa 1999 : writing . more to the point , it \\' s the refusal to acknowledge that characterizations matter when you \\' re telling a story about a relationship . the bachelor is merely the latest in a long line of films where we \\' re expected to get dewy - eyed over any pairing of attractive , pleasant people just because they \\' re attractive and pleasant . in this particular case , attractive and pleasant exhibit a is jimmy shannon ( chris o \\' donnell ) , a single guy who has been watching his friends slowly but surely sucked into marriage . it \\' s a scary notion for jimmy , even though he dearly loves attractive and pleasant exhibit b anne ( renee zellweger ) , his girlfriend of three years . convinced despite his reservations that it \\' s time to \" sh * t or get off the pot , \" jimmy proposes to anne -- very badly . anne refuses , which leaves jimmy in a very odd position when his eccentric grandfather ( peter ustinov ) dies and leaves a very specific video will . jimmy stands to inhereit $ 100 million if he is married by 6 : 05 p . m . on his 30th birthday , stays married for 10 years and produces a child . there are only a couple of minor problems : 1 ) jimmy \\' s 30th birthday is the next day ; 2 ) anne is nowhere to be found , meaning jimmy has to find another willing bride from among his many ex - girlfriends . it \\' s a wacky , brewster \\' s millions - esque premise ( acknowledged as such in one of the film \\' s better , more self - aware lines of dialogue ) , the kind where a shallow and materialistic guy learns what really matters . at least that would be the case if jimmy weren \\' t already a world - class altruist . screenwriter steve cohen slides into the story an even more draconian condition in the will : if jimmy doesn \\' t get married , not only will he lose all the money , but the family billiard table buisness will be sold out from under him , costing hudreds of jobs . from the outset , jimmy \\' s motivation isn \\' t cash ; it \\' s the livelihoods of his devoted employees . it \\' s almost embarrassing for his marital misgivings to play a role in the bachelor \\' s plot development . by any human standard , the guy is impossibly selfless . and that \\' s the essence of the gutlessness endemic to films like the bachelor -- the fear of giving the characters flaws to overcome on their way to happiness . there \\' s never any tension between the two star - crossed lovers , because there \\' s no sense that anything remotely significant is at stake . the blandly nice o \\' donnell couldn \\' t pull off a randy cad if he tried , so the filmmakers don \\' t even let him ; zellweger \\' s anne may have issues with her sickeningly affectionate parents as an impossible standard to live up to , but no one dares make her anything but the woman ( lightly ) wronged . and forget about seeing enough of jimmy and anne together to feel invested in their potential reconciliation . the parade of sit - com set pieces had better be damned funny , since they \\' re all that stands between us and a blissfully sweet foregone conclusion . i \\' ll admit a couple of those set pieces are amusing , including ustinov \\' s rantings about procreation and a restaurant full - to - bursting with men popping questions and champagne corks . far more of them are either tedious or downright ghastly , like the shudder - inducing sight of brooke shields as an icy fortune - hunter or the hideous collection of stereotypes when hundreds of potential brides gather in a church . you \\' re never going to get too many raucous belly laughs from a film like the bachelor , but that \\' s not the real problem . nor is it the real problem that you know exactly the kind of warm - n - fuzzy conclusion it \\' s leading up to . the problem are a beginning and middle that are equally warm - n - fuzzy -- there \\' s no spark , no energy , no humanity . it \\' s an emotional pudding guaranteed not to offend any consumer \\' s digestions . we \\' ve reached a point where our proxies for cinematic romantic wish fulfillment don \\' t even have a pulse . the bachelor is love among the mannequins .',\n",

n , eva , who slept her way to the top and became famous chiefly because she got attention , much like the woman playing her : madonna ( although i think madonna did rise to the top for her musical talent , among other things ) . \" evita \" deals with the rise and fall of eva per ? n , a woman who captured the heart of the nation after marrying juan ( jonathan pryce ) , then died at the young age of 33 , creating an international stir of mourning not unlike that of princess di ( the two do share a bit in common , although it wasn \\' t like di slept to \" the top \" ) . webber and rice sure chose bizarre topics for their musicals , but they always have a point for doing it . here , they wish to expose her for what she is , but still show that despite all of her many drawbacks , her lying , and covering up for her fascist husband , but show that she was still a good woman with fairly good intentions , and her death was very sad . it \\' s also a musical , with almost no words not unsung . the film plays like a rock opera , much like their \" jesus christ superstar , \" with many giant musical sequences just like the old musicals , even if they do possess very intelligent lyrics , which create not only an intellectually enlightening experience , but also a very entertaining one . after all , this is a musical , and webber \\' s musicals never undermine this . they are a balance of energy and intellectual depth , walking on a fine line between the both , and never stumbling on either side . this is why the beginning of \" evita \" is kind of a let - down . okay , it is a let - down . i \\' m not saying the opening moments are bad , because they \\' re pretty good . but what comes after is a lifeless , un - entertaining , and totally unrewarding sequence where she cons a singer ( jimmy nail ) into taking eva to buenos aires after a one - night stand . in the musical , it \\' s a fun , energetic sequence , culiminating in the show stopper , \" buenos aires , \" which is also lifeless . then a punch is pulled as we see eva being screwed over by the singer , instead of her leaving him , where she ends up singing the sad tune , \" another suitcase in another hall , \" which was meant for a later character , screwed over by eva . the portrayal of eva in the beginning is too soft , seeming like parker and oliver stone , who adapted it for the screen , are afraid to present her for what she is , even while it \\' s being narrated by a hater of eva \\' s , the omnipotent ( antonio banderas ) , who presents her in a negative light . for a while , it looks like alan parker can \\' t pull it off . however , the film pulls itself together in a flash , and after that song is over , and the giddily nihilistic song \" goodbye and thank you , \" where we see eva go through a long line of lovers who help her ascend , is magnificent , darkly comical , and just gleeful . from this point on , the film is hypnotic , satisfying , and satirical . no more punches are thrown , and the basic outline of the original musical are in tact . we see eva woo and marry juan , get him out of jail , rise to stardom , falter a bit , come back , and then gradually die of cancer ( i think it was because of cancer ) . more importantly , many of the themes from the musical carry on with this , as well as some filling - in - the - gaps reconnassaince work . juan , who is pretty underwritten in the musical , is given some extra scenes , and exposed as what he was for eva : an accessory . a muted scene where he tries to visit her respective room but is shunned allows us to learn more about juan , and understand his sadness more than we did before . > from the \" goodbye and thank you \" number on , the film shows eva trying to cover up for the horrible government by doing cheap and petty things which wooed a nation , and saved a government , even while it left the nation \\' s people downtrodden . but despite this , the nation still loved eva , and when she slipped into death , the world mourned her because she was a star . that \\' s when our narrator , ch ? , comes out to show that she wasn \\' t the great woman she really was , and expose her fame . describing this character is difficult , mainly because he has no real realistic background ( he \\' s said to be based on the revolutionary ch ?

              " ('eyes wide shut isn \\' t the masterpiece many were hoping to see in stanley kubrick \\' s final film , but it is an impressive achievement ; a mesmerizing , haunting , adult psychodrama about marriage , fidelity and sex . it \\' s a stanley kubrick film from beginning to end , consistently exhibiting the auteur \\' s trademark penchant for long , continuous takes , his unparalleled deftness behind the camera and his uncanny ability to extract gorgeous performances from his exhausted cast ( indeed , eyes wide shut attained infamy even before its release for its notoriously laborious shoot : kubrick , a renowned perfectionist , reportedly held his cast \" hostage \" on the set for nearly a year ) . in an uncharacteristic maneuver , kubrick cast two big - name stars in the lead roles , namely real - life husband and wife tom cruise and nicole kidman . they play bill and alice harford , a volatile couple who , during the course of a couple nights , ponder the validity of the idea that a husband and a wife must be faithful to each other . he is an m . d . , she \\' s unemployed and we are introduced to them as they are getting ready to go to a fancy party . at the affair , they are both propositioned and both nearly succumb to the temptation to play around with someone else . when they return to their lavish new york apartment kidman ( after smoking a dash of weed ) inquires whether her husband had sex with two models who approached him during the night . he ( truthfully ) says that he did not and asks what happened with that hungarian guy she was dancing with . they proceed to argue until alice tells her spouse a lustful story : evidently some time ago , she had a thing for a young naval officer . she admits that she was ready to give up her whole future with bill and their young daughter if this guy wanted her even for one night . bill is jolted by alice \\' s story and we anticipate his reaction , but at that moment he gets a phone call and has to go \" show his face \" at the house of a just - deceased patient . this turns out to be the beginning of a long and eventful night on the town . the daughter of the dead patient hits on him but he wisely turns her down . he almost does the dirty deed with a kindly hooker who approaches him on the street . then , through a series of coincidences , he winds up at a gothic mansion where a ritualistic ( and frankly , creepy ) orgy takes place , with costumed people performing various public sex acts on each other . erotic dread mounts as cruise ( who \\' s not supposed to be there ) wonders the spacious halls watching the \" action \" until he is discovered to be an outsider . much hoopla has been raised over the fact that warner bros . digitally edited the orgy scene . with the help of a computer , they put in cloaked figures to block some of the actual sex acts ( they can still be seen , just not in all their glory ) in order to avoid the dreaded nc - 17 rating . european viewers will see the film as kubrick envisioned it . roger ebert calls the american version the \" austin powers version , \" and many others have bashed the alterations . i am of the potentially controversial opinion that the figures only supplement the scene \\' s mystical atmosphere . the first thing one notices about eyes wide shut is how it looks . this is an artful , distinctively gorgeous production , shot in dark , moody hues and featuring some elaborate , beautiful scenery . from the giant mansion used in the film \\' s centerpiece to the decor at the christmas party to the harford \\' s apartment , this film is always a pleasure to look at . to boot , a great soundtrack makes it more atmospheric still . at the core , behind the graphic , controversial content and unappealing mood , this is a good - natured movie that emphasizes the importance of fidelity . it looks at sex as almost perfunctory by portraying it as unnerving rather than erotic . it \\' s something superficial and yet something necessary to achieve a deeper relationship . at the end , it seems , bill \\' s eyes are wide open to the special kind of love he and his wife have for each other , more meaningful than anything he could ever hope to find on the streets of new york . kubrick elicits wonderful performances from both cruise and kidman . tom is completely convincing as dr . harford , a man who seems guided solely by destiny , with no control of the course his life will take . nicole projects a quiet intensity as the jittery yet aggressive wife and her performance is stunningly effective : she \\' s headed for an oscar nod . the movie has some help from a similarly strong supporting cast , at the head of which is director - cum - thespian sidney pollock , enigmatic and articulate as harford \\' s mysterious friend . eyes wide shut is not perfect : the last hour could have used a slightly more scissor - happy editor and both cruise and kidman are too good - looking for me to believe that either would have a very strong temptation to philander . still , this is an important work from a great director , and while it may not be on par with some of stanley kubrick \\' s best it is a worthy final film , a complex exploration of jealousy and faithfulness . ? 1999 eugene novikov &# 137 ;',\n",

              " ('after watching the first ten minutes of this japanese film , you will never eat a bowl of ramen the same way again . there is a scene where an old man is teaching a young one how to eat the soupy bowl of noodles , as a master would teach an eager apprentice . \" you caress the noodles with the chopsticks , \" he says , \" then put the roast pork on the side of the bowl and apologize to it by saying , \\' see you soon . \\' \" of course , it \\' s meant to be a parody , but there is an earnestness underneath the silliness that makes you take it with a certain degree of sobriety . you begin to appreciate the food as not merely something you eat , not something you like , not something you enjoy , but rather something you experience . experiencing it is a process which engages all of the senses , fulfilling each one on its own terms and weaving them so that the total is a pleasure that is more than the sum of its parts . trust me , you really want to go find a noodle shop at this point . juzo itami \\' s tampopo brings the same sense of the serious parody of food to the forefront by making the story follow the pattern of an american western , set in modern day japan . a stranger , goro ( tsutomu yamazaki ) , comes into town and finds tampopo ( nobuko miyamoto ) , the proprietor of a small , hole - in - the - wall noodle shop , trying to fend off the insults of the local strongman , pisken ( rikiya yasuoka ) . goro , to defend the honor of this woman and her noodles , gets into a fight with the ringleader and his henchmen , emerging bloodied , but victorious . goro finds that tampopo \\' s ambition is to have a shop that people would flock to from far away , just to eat a bowl of her ramen . the problem is , her fare is something less than popular , and less than appetizing . however , goro agrees to help tampopo in her quest , and in the process they seek the wisdom of an elderly noodle expert , enlist the aid of a wealthy patron , and make friends with the former enemy . this film is filled with many little scenes which are absolute gems . take , for example , when tampopo tries to buy the recipe for a delicious soup from another shop owner . the price is too high , but the owner of the store next door will secretly sell it to her for a more affordable sum . tampopo meets him at his store late at night , and he leads her to a back room . she protests , thinking that perhaps this man has ulterior motives , but he insists . just when she is about to bolt for the exit , he shows her a small gap in the wall adjoining his store with the noodle shop next door . she peers through and takes notes as she watches the cook make the soup for the next day , her face filled with a joy that can be felt by the audience . this scene , while comical , is very effective at filling the viewer with a sense of trepidation , then of relief and discovery . there \\' s also an interesting scene where goro introduces tampopo and her son to a bunch of street people who , despite their economic trappings , are all gourmets and master sommeliers . we even watch as one of them sneaks into the kitchen of a restaurant and expertly prepares a french omelet . the scene is meant to bring a laugh , but it also says that no matter whether people are rich or poor , food is something which everyone has in common , and the enjoyment of food is an experience shared by all . there are also a number of unrelated vignettes appearing throughout the film , which help to illustrate and accentuate the role of food in people \\' s lives . a particularly effective one involves a wife and mother being tended to in her home by a doctor . surrounded by her children , she is obviously in her last hours of life . her husband comes home , and seeing her worsened condition , demands that she get up and make dinner . the viewer knows the husband \\' s intention is not to be mean ; he is desperate for the normalcy of which he and his family has obviously been deprived , and the wife making dinner is an essential part of this . in a near miracle , the wife drags herself to the kitchen and prepares a quick meal , then brings it to her awaiting family . as the family eats , she looks on them and smiles . preparing food for her family is a joy and a comfort to her , and for a brief moment , she too enjoys the normalcy . then she falls over , dead . for a moment , the family is stunned , but then the father yells at the children , \" keep eating ! this is the last meal your mother ever made ! \" crying as they do so , the family finishes the meal . the scene is comical , awkward , moving , and beautiful . by including the vignettes , itami ran the risk of creating a disjointed film , but surprisingly , they do not interrupt the pacing of the main storyline . instead , they even help contribute to the idea that tampopo \\' s goal of being able to serve exceptional food is worthy and even noble . because the film parodies a western , the construction of the plot is fairly predictable , but is still enjoyable as we watch the familiar way in which the \" good guys \" come together for the final showdown . in this case , the showdown is against the ramen . if they eat tampopo \\' s ramen , soup and all , tampopo knows she has succeeded . it \\' s pretty obvious what the outcome will be , but when a film changes your whole perspective on something you consume every day of your life , you can afford to cut it a little slack .',\n",

              " ('here \\' s something to chew on : what \\' s the favorite food of big , cheesy - looking special effects monsters like the one lurking in the bowels of a luxury liner in deep rising ? the obvious answer to this question is cardboard , because that \\' s the depth of the most fully - developed character in this painfully generic creature feature . deep rising demonstrates all the originality and vitality of something scripted by a computer . in fact , considering the rigid adherence to the expected formulas , perhaps it was . the most astonishing thing about deep rising is the exceptionally high level of gore . not since starship troopers have this many chunks of flesh ( both human and non - human ) been scattered in all directions . we learn some bloody trivia , as well , such as how a sea monster spraypaints in red ( it drinks a human being then spits out the liquefied remains ) and what it does with half - digested leftovers . i suppose deep rising \\' s gallery of grotesque images represents fun stuff for those who love the macabre , but it doesn \\' t do much for me . on the surface , and that \\' s about the only level at which this film can be analyzed , deep rising feels like tremors grafted onto titanic ( everyone else is citing the equally valid aliens / titanic connection , since james cameron directed both ) . in going for the big disaster angle of titanic and the tongue - in - cheek mayhem of tremors , deep rising somehow misses both marks by a wide margin . the film is not humorous , tense , or exciting . in fact , it \\' s downright boring , and , despite being half the length of cameron \\' s current box - office champ , deep rising feels like the longer movie . is it really necessary to say anything about the plot ? probably not , since it \\' s easy to guess , but i \\' ll go ahead and oblige anyone who wants a synopsis . the film opens by introducing us to a gang of bad guys on board a mercenary ship . in addition to the usual cast of psychopaths and lunatics , there \\' s finnegan ( treat williams ) , the boat \\' s pilot , who \\' s supposed to be an indiana jones knockoff ; joey ( kevin j . o \\' connor ) , the inept sidekick who \\' s supposed to be lovable and funny ( but is really just irritating ) ; and hanover ( wes studi ) , the \" mastermind \" ( and i use that term lightly ) of the operation . their goal : attack a cruise ship , clean out the safe , then sink it using some illegally - acquired torpedoes . the problem is , by the time they reach the argonautica , the titanic - like luxury liner has turned into the marie celeste . aside from a beautiful jewel thief ( famke janssen ) and a couple of crew members , there \\' s no one on board . the reason soon becomes obvious -- the ship has been taken over by a bad special effect that is supposed to resemble an octopus with teeth and more than eight tentacles . the cast , which is led by treat williams , is primarily comprised of has - beens and probably - never - will - bes ( two exceptions : wes studi , best known as the villain in the last of the mohicans , and djimon hounsou , amistad \\' s cinque ) . williams , once a \" can \\' t miss \" prospect in hollywood , has fallen so far out of favor that the best he can do these days for a lead role is a film like deep rising , and his inability to create a charismatic or interesting figure here may sink whatever is left of his sputtering career . famke janssen , who will forever be known as xenia onatopp from goldeneye , is the perfect bland match for williams . given her limited acting abilities , it \\' s likely that she was chosen for this part primarily on the basis of her physical attributes . unfortunately , a bra defeats the purpose of having her in a wet tee - shirt for half of the picture . meanwhile , kevin j . o \\' connor , who has entirely too much screen time , exhibits all the appeal of fingernails scratching a blackboard . these days , audiences are becoming more difficult to impress with computer - generated special effects . this is a lesson that writer / director stephen sommers ( who previously helmed the live - action jungle book ) needs to learn . the days of jurassic park , when viewers were astounded by the mere spectacle of seeing something big and imposing on screen , are past . now , movie - goers are looking for the sophistication of titanic -- visuals that are so well - incorporated that it \\' s impossible to tell where they end and where \" reality \" begins . in deep rising , the monster , like everything , is artificial and unconvincing . unfortunately , the fundamental problem audiences are faced with here isn \\' t so much the idiotic monotony of this individual picture , but the poor quality of the entire bankrupt genre ( although , to be fair , deep rising is a particularly bad entry ) . even once this film has sunk out of sight , the knowledgeable viewer knows it won \\' t be the last of its kind . like the slimy , slithering things that inhabit the air vents and pipes of these movies , more are waiting just around the corner in ambush . and that consideration , unlike anything on screen , is truly horrifying .',\n",

and rachel griffiths is wonderfully immature as jude \\' s wife , whom he never divorces . \" jude \" moves at a very slow pace , and keeps taunting its viewers with chances of happiness for its protagonists , which would drive some people nuts . but those who appreciate good social commentary with their films , no matter how slow or downright depressing they are ( this one is both ) will appreciate \" jude , \" though i doubt anyone truly enjoys it .',\n",

              " ('i like movies with albert brooks , and i really like movies directed and written by albert brooks . lost in america and defending your life are two of my favorite comedies . his humor is of a kind that is not very prevalent in movies today , inundated as we are with films which revel in their aim toward the lowest common denominator . you will rarely see any slapstick in an albert brooks film , while the dialog will not be as oppressive as in some of the independent \" talk films \" which are finding their way into theaters . the situations in which his characters find themselves are ones we can often identify with , but even if we can \\' t , brooks has the talent to make them comfortable , and therefore we laugh . teenagers and jim carrey fans probably won \\' t find an albert brooks movie very funny , but people who look for more than what we could find on television probably will . put simply , brooks \\' comedy is intelligent . mother is albert brooks \\' latest film , and it does not disappoint . brooks plays john henderson , a middle - aged science fiction writer just coming off his second divorce . he makes an attempt at dating , but fails miserably . he then has dinner with his brother jeff ( rob morrow ) , a successful sports agent who seems to live the ideal life . jeff has a good job , a loving family , and most of all , a warm relationship with their mother beatrice ( debbie reynolds ) . after dinner , john witnesses a telephone conversation between jeff and beatrice , and is at the same time amazed and sickened by how hunky - dory the dialog is . in comparison , beatrice always hints at a fault in john and his career every time she talks with him , and john gives it right back to her . at the end of one of their conversations where beatrice has just picked apart john \\' s life , she says , \" i love you , \" and john replies with , \" i know you think you do . \" the thing is , beatrice is not overt with her criticisms , but instead gives them in that mothering way which is tantamount to nit - picking and guilt loading . it \\' s the kind that goes something like , \" yes , dear , i think you do that wonderfully , but . . . . \" it seems as though nothing he does makes her happy . there \\' s always the big but . john believes that his mother is somehow connected to his failed relationships with women , either because of his flawed self - esteem caused by his need for validation , or perhaps because he tends to unconsciously seek out women who remind him of his mother in an oedipal manner . he comes to the conclusion that since his problems are rooted in his boyhood home , he should move back in with his mother for a while just to see what kinds of feelings come out , and by that be able to sort out why his life is the way it is . \" a great experiment \" , he calls it . brooks \\' own brand of humor really shines in this film , especially in the interaction john has with his mother . there \\' s a scene where john has just arrived at his mother \\' s house , and after having driven from los angeles to sausalito , and having explained to his mother about the \" great experiment \" , beatrice asks , \" now explain to me again why you don \\' t want to stay at a hotel . \" she still doesn \\' t get it , and it is absolutely hilarious . in the same scene , we get little glances at the life his mother leads when she tries to feed him food that is no longer fresh . she apparently buys in great quantities and refrigerates it until the lettuce is wilted and the sherbet is iced over . when john points out the ice on the sherbet , beatrice tells him not to worry about the protective glaze . \" you \\' ve named the ice ? \" asks john . he \\' s also surprised at the variety of items beatrice keeps in the refrigerator , such as a twenty - pound block of cheese . \" the freezer was a good invention , \" says john , \" but it \\' s not supposed to be used for everything . that \\' s why it \\' s smaller than the refrigerator . \" it \\' s something most of us find strangely familiar . brooks is also a master at employing the non sequitur . for example , in defending your life , his and meryl streep \\' s characters are in a comedy club having a discussion . when they \\' re finished and walk out , brooks cuts to the comic on stage who is just at the point of delivering his punch line , \" and so the moral is , if you have to fart , go outside ! \" you don \\' t know what the joke was because you couldn \\' t hear him during the entire scene , but i must have laughed for the next five minutes , it seemed so out of context . in this film , brooks uses the same trick a couple of times to open or close a scene . i don \\' t want to give them away , but suffice it to say they work just as well as they have in the past . john \\' s purpose for staying with his mother is to learn , and we as the audience learn right along with him . his mother is not the fascinating type to begin with , but as john spends more time with her , we learn things about her personality and her lifestyle that give her depth . watching the character of beatrice unfold is every bit as enjoyable as the humor that accompanies it each step of the way . on screen , brooks does an excellent job playing this kind of character : you get the feeling he often believes he is the only sane person in an insane world . in a way , he \\' s very much like yosarian of catch - 22 , expect with something of an attitude . casting debbie reynolds as beatrice is perfect . she assumes the part with ease , even moving and speaking a little slowly , and is just so adorable it \\' s hard to get mad at her character . this only helps the audience to share the frustration john feels when dealing with her . as his first choice , brooks originally wanted to lure nancy reagan out from her acting retirement to play beatrice , but the former actress and first lady could not leave her husband , who was beginning to show symptoms of alzheimer \\' s disease . that may be just as well , since reynolds lends a softness to the character which enhances it immensely . rob morrow also does a good job at playing the younger brother who has always been mother \\' s favorite and , for all his success in his job and family , is slowly exposed as a mama \\' s boy . the only things that hold this movie back from being better are a couple of plot holes . a solid connection is not really made between john \\' s troubles and his reasons for living with his mother . additionally , the end results of the experiment do not necessarily jibe with the stated goals , and although this may have been sloppy screenwriting , how can you be mad at the guy who also wrote this ? : beatrice : you must think i \\' m some kind of moron . john : no , i think your someone who thinks i \\' m a moron . beatrice : well , it takes one to know one .',\n",

              " ('note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . be forewarned . east meets west in mulan , the latest installment in disney \\' s parade of annual animated feature films . an odd fusion of ancient asian traditions and disconcerting elements which betray obvious mass - market commercial sensibilities , this confident entry is easily the most engaging and satisfying hollywood animated feature in years , but falls short of actualizing its potential . though not for lack of trying . in many respects , mulan is among disney \\' s most mature efforts , skirting the surface of adult themes and daring to sneak glimpses into the messier side of combat . the violence of the battles in the film are admittedly sanitized -- the imagery of a pillaged village , neatly encapsulated in the form of a child \\' s discarded doll , is in itself no more harrowing than luke discovering his fallen guardians in star wars , and mulan \\' s later heroics in dispatching of the ruthless invaders is done so in the most tidy , bloodless method imaginable -- yet how often does a hollywood animated film , long considered as the last safe refuge for the innocent , dare touch upon the consequential horrors of war in such a provocative manner ? in an instant , idealistic mulan \\' s innocence is lost , and her jovial squadron are reminded of what their efforts are spent defending . the film , based upon an ancient chinese fable , centers on a spirited young woman who disguises herself as a man in order to serve as her family \\' s obligatory conscript when china finds itself under attack by huns ( cartoonishly depicted by easy demonic overtones , replete with glowing yellow eyes and dagger - edged teeth , although lent a surprisingly genuine sense of menace ) . dipping into the mythology of other cultures for the first time after cavorting in animated revisitings of familiar western / european fables and literature for decades , disney \\' s new film is boldly set in ancient china rather than relocated elsewhere , story intact , to some neutral territory , and revels in its east asian roots ; aside from a predominantly asian - american cast providing the film \\' s vocal work , there \\' s liberal usage of oriental iconography throughout , and the artwork reveal hints of japanese anime influence . while the film does occasionally reach its limits and starts to tread upon old stereotypes -- invoking pseudo - asian references to items like beancurd and rice in every third sentence grows rather hoary , and i can \\' t imagine that the regiment for ancient chinese warriors * really * included karate - chopping blocks of stone in two -- it \\' s rather remarkable that a movie primarily positioned for american and european audiences delves so wholeheartedly into new foreign territory . the film also freely touches upon cultural idiosyncrasies from its outset ; although savvy viewers should easily pick up on the intrinsics immediately , it \\' s startlingly assertive in providing as little shorthand as it does to unfamiliar youngsters with regards to the customs and traditions of mulan \\' s land . at its core , the film is a tale of heroic adventure , and as such paints its story in bold strokes of honour , perseverance , nobility and courage . as such , animation is the perfect vehicle for this flavour of epic , where stark emotional simplicity is able to effectively work hand - in - hand with visual purity . scenes which would play out as unbearably hokey in live action , such as mulan \\' s venerable father pridefully tossing aside his cane when accepting his draft notice , are lent a sense of strength and conveyed with greater emotional clarity in animation . mulan capitalizes on this during its strongest moments , particularly during our heroine \\' s character - defining opening half - hour . it \\' s when the film attempts to integrate the traditional mainstays of recent hollywood animation -- the friendly animal sidekick , the colourful array of supporting characters -- into the mix where it goes slightly awry . off to battle , mulan finds herself being trailed by a jive - talking diminutive dragon called mushu and an agreeable little \" lucky \" cricket , who ostensibly appear to assist in her subterfuge and realistically serve as audience - friendly comic relief . they \\' re affable presences , and not precisely ineffective -- reasonable amounts of humour are elicited , and eddie murphy ( who voices mushu ) is amusingly earnest -- but amidst all the high melodrama , the effect is mildly jarring and , from a storytelling perspective , questionable in its necessity . at training camp , mulan antagonizes and eventually wins over a trio of fumbling recruits ( easily characterized simply as the short clown , the skinny clown , and the big clown ) , who provide more levity into the film with decidedly less effectiveness , and , in a familiar retread of traditional disney patterns , she grows a certain fondness for a handsome , square - jawed young captain , shang . everybody needs love , even ancient chinese warrior princesses , but not necessarily in * this * film . the romantic angle , which lets the air out of the sails of the story \\' s neo - feminist underpinnings , lacks any genuine spark and plays out like a contractual obligation . another staple of recent disney animated films , a cache of hummable little ditties , has also obligingly been carried over to mulan but proves to be a decided weakness . composed by matthew wilder , none of the handful of tunes are particularly distinguishing , and one -- \" i \\' ll make a man out of you \" ( unimaginatively accompanying a tired montage featuring our crew of characters transforming into lean fighting machines ) -- becomes so grating and hackneyed that it seems almost interminable . only \" reflections \" , an early ballad of lament , proves to be a song of any consequence , serving as an effective showcase for lea salonga , one of musical theatre \\' s most wondrously pure voices . nonetheless , mulan is an especially appealing piece of work from the disney factory , with a strong narrative arc and pleasant artwork ; the computer - generated stampede of hun warriors charging down a snow mountain is wholly impressive . while the blatantly child - friendly elements at times seem incongruous with the remainder of the film , they \\' re not dissuasive and remain fairly enjoyable . briskly paced with a smart , energetic heroine and filled with high adventure , the film is ultimately most satisfying on the intimate scale of father and daughter .',\n",

              " ('john boorman \\' s \" zardoz \" is a goofy cinematic debacle so fundamentally misconceived and laughably executed that it takes on a bizarre enjoyment quality all its own . not since the rampant bumblings of one edward d . wood jr . has a movie been so silly and so serious at the same time . of course , wood \\' s career can be explained by two things : he had no money and he had no talent . boorman , on the other hand , cannot court such excuses to explain \" zardoz \" ( or his follow - up film , the equally awful \" exorcist ii : the heretic \" ) . boorman obviously had a sizable budget , a matinee idol movie star ( sean connery ) in the lead role , and although you wouldn \\' t know it from this film , boorman does indeed have talent . this is the man who made the slick modern masterpiece \" deliverance \" ( 1972 ) , as well as the autobiographical world war ii drama \" hope and glory \" ( 1987 ) , the slightly over - conceived arthurian epic \" excalibur \" ( 1981 ) and the father - son jungle adventure \" the emerald forest \" ( 1985 ) . his films all show that boorman is never lacking in imagination , but sometimes that comes at the cost of coherence and taste . if boorman is anything , he \\' s ambitious , and when he succeeds , it \\' s in grand fashion . unfortunately , the bigger they are , the harder they fall , and when boorman falls , the resounding impact can be heard for miles around . \" zardoz \" is meant to takes its place among the grandest of mystical movies , an obsession of boorman \\' s . his screenplay tries to elicit the same mythological connotations of the arthurian legends or even \" the wizard of oz , \" a book which figures into the movie \\' s plot . but , despite all this reaching , the resulting movie is more unintentionally funny than intentionally enigmatical or compelling . the events take place in the distant year 2293 , but there is little of the typical futuristic movie - ness to be found . in fact , things seems to have moved backwards , with people riding horses , shooting old - style guns , and living in large victorian mansions . it \\' s more middle ages than space age . the world of \" zardoz \" is divided into two distinct hemispheres : the outlands , where all the poor , pathetic people live , and the vortex , where a select group of wealthy intellectuals live in comfort and everlasting life . these immortals never grow old , they never engage in sexual activity , they possess psychological powers , and they live in a sort of quasi - utopian marxist society where everyone is equal , and everyone contributes equally to the society . however , if one breaks the rules , that person is punished by being aged so many years . if someone breaks the rules enough , he or she is aged to the point of senility , and imprisoned to an eternal existence in a geriatric home with others aged criminals . one of the immortals , arthur frayn ( niall buggy ) , a squirmy man with a mustache and goatee tattooed on his face , is charged with keeping order in the outlands and forcing the residents to farm so the immortals can be fed . like \" the wizard of oz , \" he adopts a god - like status among the people by flying in to their part of the world in a giant stone carved like a menacing head . ( this flying head is one of the movie \\' s opening images , and it \\' s a dead giveaway of the lunacy to come . ) calling himself zardoz , frayn gathers a bunch of outlanders and makes them into a group called the exterminators , whose purpose is to kill most of the other outlanders so they can \\' t procreate and take up more resources . from inside his giant , stone head , zardoz bellows seriously laugh - inducting statements like , \" the gun is good . the penis is evil . \" that line alone is worth the movie \\' s cult following . one day , an exterminator named zed ( sean connery ) , sneaks into zardoz \\' s flying stone , pushes frayn out , and goes back to the vortex . once there , the immortals label him a \" brutal \" and study him like a lab rat , taking great , perverse care in exploring his sexuality , which is a mystery to them . they seem especially interested in his ability to gain an erection , and there is one downright hilarious sequence where a bunch of scantily - clad female scientists show zed erotic footage on a video screen in an attempt to determine what gets him worked up . i say \" hilarious \" because that is exactly what \" zardoz \" is . it is obvious that boorman did not intend it to be so ; he made this film with the straightest of faces , although i have a hard time believing that as production moved forward , he didn \\' t get even the slightest inkling of how patently ridiculous it was becoming . just looking at connery is enough to give one the giggles - he spends most of the film running around in a red loin cloth that resembles a diaper , a mane of hair braided halfway down his back , a wyatt earp - style handlebar mustache , and a pair of thigh - high patent leather boots that would look more appropriate on a cheap hollywood hooker . boorman made the film right after the critical and financial success of \" deliverance , \" which is the only reason i can imagine a studio would green - light this effort . he attracted some rich talent on both sides of the camera , including cinematographer geoffrey unsworth ( \" 2001 \" ) , whose striking visuals are about the only good thing in \" zardoz \" besides the inadvertent humor . sean connery had made his last james bond film in 1971 , and perhaps he was looking for a change in pace . he got exactly that in \" zardoz , \" and it \\' s a wonder it didn \\' t end his career . i \\' m sure boorman intended for this movie to make some grand statements . is it a treatise about the infallibility of eternal life ? is it a condemnation of those who consider growing old to be a bad thing ? or is it a social statement , something about the inherent negativity of class distinctions and the violence it creates ? karl marx might like it if he were more like timothy leary . come to think of it , maybe boorman made it as an extended lsd trip . people high on illicit substances are the only ones i can imagine enjoying this asinine silliness as anything more than a completely unintentional comedy .',\n",

              " ('call it touched by a demon . gregory hoblit \\' s fallen is a serial killer movie with an unusual , horrific twist . if marketed properly , this film could have crossover appeal for both those who appreciate supernatural tales like the prophesy and those who crave grim , dark thrillers like silence of the lambs and seven . in fact , there \\' s even a little twin peaks to be found here , albeit with the lion \\' s share of the weirdness distilled out . ( remember bob ? ) the biggest failing of fallen is that , although it \\' s consistently interesting , it \\' s not always as edgy and suspenseful as one might hope . a serial killer ( elias koteas ) has been on the loose in philadephia , but detective john hobbes ( denzel washington ) , the noblest man on the police force , has brought him to justice . now , during his last hours on death row awaiting his inevitable date with the gas chamber , the mass murderer cryptically tells hobbes , \" what goes around really goes around . \" shortly thereafter , he begins to sing \" time is on my side \" as he \\' s taken on his last walk . minutes later , the state of pennsylvania has carried out the execution and edgar reese is dead . but for hobbes , the nightmare is just beginning , because reese wasn \\' t a normal psychopath ? he was the host body for a mythical dark angel named azazel . and , with reese \\' s death , azazel is free to hop from body to body , murdering and wreaking havoc at will . only hobbes and a pretty , female theology teacher ( embeth davidtz ) have an inkling of what they \\' re up against . the rest of the cops , including hobbes \\' partner , jonesy ( john goodman ) ; lou ( james gandolfini ) , a newcomer to the department ; and lieutenant stanton ( donald sutherland ) , don \\' t have a clue , and , as a result , they are in mortal danger . as depicted by hoblit ( primal fear ) and cinematographer newton thomas sigel , philadelphia is a dark , dreary place ? a gothic city rather than a modern one . no skyscrapers or other monoliths of current architecture or technology are shown . the most famous landmark to appear isn \\' t the liberty bell or independence hall ; it \\' s geno \\' s steaks . shadows and night scenes abound . the days are cloudy and unpromising . this is the kind of setting where it \\' s easy to believe that fallen angels walk among men . fallen \\' s plot is brimming with potential , not all of which is realized . somehow , i would have expected a more frightening tale to emerge from something with this kind of premise . but the level of terror , like that of gore , is kept in check . nevertheless , there are several creepily effective scenes as the spirit of azazel moves from body to body when people bump against each other on crowded city sidewalks . the film also boasts a chase sequence of a kind that can best be described as unusual . of the several dozen actors to play azazel , the best is by far elias koteas ( exotica , crash ) , who , despite only being on screen for about ten minutes , gives a fantastically charged performance . john goodman also seems to be enjoying himself , although his role for most of the film is relegated to that of a burly sidekick . sadly , however , these two are the only ones who excel . everyone else , including denzel washington , is boring . washington \\' s flat performance is the most disappointing surprise of the film . it \\' s not that he \\' s bad per se , but he \\' s not very interesting . there \\' s no real sense of vulnerability or desperation in the way he portrays his character , and that keeps us distanced , however slightly , from hobbes . as circumstances become progressively more dire for the cop , and as his life - or - death chess game with azazel approaches the point of checkmate , i expected to be more on the edge of my seat than i was . washington \\' s subdued approach is part of the reason for this ; i never felt a sense of urgency . however , at least washington was believable , which is more than can be said for embeth davidtz ( schindler \\' s list ) and donald sutherland . to be fair , the flaws in their characters aren \\' t all acting - related ; neither stanton nor gretta milano are well - written . that said , however , there \\' s nothing inspired about either davidtz \\' s or sutherland \\' s work . both appear to be sleepwalking their way through the parts , as if they know that their contribution to the film is one of advancing the plot rather than developing a multi - dimensional individual . narratively , fallen has a few glaring weaknesses . although the plot proceeds with a convoluted , game - like structure , it uses a denzel washington - supplied voiceover to overexplain matters . at times , this is actually helpful , and it has a use beyond the obvious , but there are occasions when ponderous lines like \" i like the night ? sometimes you come face to face with yourself \" become a little hard to swallow . in addition , fallen is saddled with the same kind of disgustingly bland , generic theology embraced by numerous movies and tv shows like touched by an angel . however , despite the negatives , i \\' m still recommending fallen on the strength of its complex plot and especially its ending , which i loved . the final scenes are startling , audacious , and unexpected . it \\' s not often that a plot development takes me by surprise the way this one did . at a time when most movies fall apart in the last ten minutes , fallen manages to buck the trend and redeem itself . this is not a great motion picture , but , considering how bad most january releases are , it \\' s a reasonably entertaining way to spend two hours . and , whatever you do , don \\' t walk out on the film before the end credits have begun to roll .',\n",

              " ('capsule : this is a harrowing look at a rarely dramatized chapter of wwii , life in a japanese prison camp . to end all wars is a moving film about the struggle of prisoners to retain their humanity and their dignity . the somewhat religious interpretation may not be to everyone \\' s taste . , + 3 ( - 4 to + 4 ) more than any other people the japanese seem capable of acting with one goal and not letting any other consideration get in their way . this may be a holdover from the code of bushido when loyalty to ones master was the only law . during world war ii , of course , the one goal was winning the war . this led them to do some very inhuman things in pursuit of that goal . when the japanese had captured prisoners , they were very much treated in whatever way would be optimum for achieving the one goal . minimum resources were to be spent in maintaining prisoners in keeping with maximal positive output . while the germans , not known for their kindness in those days , had a 6 % mortality rate among captured prisoners of war , the mortality rate of japanese prisoners of war was 27 % . the best thing for the war effort was working prisoners nearly to death on the thailand to burma railroad . that railroad was needed if japan was to attack india as it planned to do . the best thing for the effort was not to waste much food on the prisoners so short and amazingly wretched food was the order of the day . and just being in the jungle without proper medical aid took its toll . in the public mind japan has never been held as accountable for war atrocities as was germany . filmmakers have been reticent to tell the story , perhaps for fear of offending the japanese . there are comparatively few films about the japanese pow camps . certainly there was david lean \\' s the bridge on the river kwai . there were some low - budget british exploitation films and that was about it . then there were tv series \" a town like alice \" and \" tenko . \" lest the experience be forgotten we have a new film to end all wars directed by david cunningham and written by brian godawa . it is based on the account of ernest gordan who survived the horror of that world war ii prison camp and went on to become for 26 years the dean of the chapel at princeton university . the film while realistic shows the conditions in the camp as being considerably more brutal and sadistic than bridge on the river kwai portrayed them . the story opens with six or so soldiers being marched into the prison camp only to be immediately placed in front of a firing squad . it turns out to be a grim joke , one of many that the sadistic japanese play to amuse themselves . beating and torture are commonplace events . men already imprisoned tell the new arrivals to enjoy the last of their health ; it will not last long with parasites and disease almost inevitable . however , unlike as in kwai , the prisoners want to avoid going to the hospital , called by the prisoners the death house . so goes a war within a war with the prisoners trying to maintain their humanity and with the japanese trying to make them interchangeable and highly expendable cogs in a rail - laying machine . this is more than just a battle of who will win the war but a battle of ideologies . the japanese believe that the individual is nothing , that conformity to group \\' s norms is all that gives a life meaning . conformity is purpose . before the film is over there will be some surprising revelations about the character of the prisoners and the character of those running the camp . if this story showed nothing but sadism from the japanese it would be one kind of story . if the british ( with one american , by the way ) and the japanese learned to respect each other it would be another kind of story . it is neither . it is a stirring and believable account of camp life . the color has been distorted in the film to give a washed out yellow . this serves a double purpose for cunningham . it gives an effect of technicolor film that has been left in heat . it also creates a distancing effect . the only touch that seems a little out of place is the use of gaelic music . this is a powerful and philosophical view of the prison camp experience . i rate it a 9 on the 0 to 10 scale and a + 3 on the - 4 to + 4 scale .',\n",

              " ('it is with hesitance that i call \" apocalypse now \" a masterpiece . certainly , it had the pedigree to be one of the greatest films ever made , with a director known for producing masterpieces with ease , and some of the finest actors of the 1970 \\' s . the plot , an adaptation of joseph conrad \\' s \" heart of darkness \" , was set in vietnam , and the timing of the film was supposed to be brilliant , coming on the heels of the end of the war . \" apocalypse \" certainly has its moments , some of which are the finest in film history . the plot is fairly simple . captain willard ( sheen ) , is a troubled soldier who came back to hanoi for a 2nd tour of duty . his mission is simple : take a boat up to cambodian territory , and destroy the command of renegade colonel kurtz ( brando ) \" with extreme prejudice \" . along the way , willard runs into a series of adventures , including one with lt . col . kilgore ( duvall ) , and a strange encounter with playboy bunnies . willard \\' s four person crew finally make it to kurtz \\' compound , where he discovers kurtz has set himself up as a god among the natives . willard \\' s experiences with kurtz take up the last half - hour , with a confrontation and eventual ending . the movie is visually breathtaking . the battle scenes are exquisitely done , and the score is brilliant , setting a murky mood of darkness that is first - rate . the collage of disturbing images that coppola presents is at times both astonishing and sickening . the vast amount of detail poured into every war scene is stunning , and there are many episodes that are deeply powerful which resonate through the entire movie . the journey to kurtz \\' camp is quite a ride , with psychosis setting in on almost every character . the most interesting one is kilgore , the lt . col . who cares more about the surf than about the mission . it is at times revolting , psychotic , and incredible , and it is one hell of a movie . the scenes are bold , inventive , and powerful , and the acting is stunning , especially be sheen , duvall , and fishburne . the narration is exquisite , as is the mystery of kurtz . coppola sets about a hallucinatory ride through vietnam , kind of like \" saving private ryan \" on lsd . the film is jarring in its implications , and psychotic in its execution . the problems come when the film slows down . one of the major scenes in the film , where the boat arrives at the final army checkpoint before they start their search for kurtz , is a colossal mess . the dialogue is confusing , the lighting is atrocious , and the scene drags on for 10 terrible minutes of film . the true problems happen after the crew does come into the kurtz compound . the film slows down to a drag . sheen seems forever captured by a madman , played by brando is a lazy performance that is not deserving of the accolades it received . brando is in the film for no more than 15 minutes , but is bathed in shadows the entire time , making the last half hour of the film visually pathetic . the scenes are poorly done , the dialogue is muffled , and the whole mess is utterly confusing beyond all belief . sheen seems to adore this man , but why the viewers are never told . the entire journey is supposed to be a prelude for a stunning entrance of this god - like kurtz , but the scenes fall way short of expectations . granted , it has its moments , which are brutally horrific , but the general feeling is one of confusion . brando mumbles his lines in a incoherent stir , and my feeling was that this could never be a great man , this could never be a man who inspires hundreds to follow him , so why do they do it ? there are moments of brilliance , but the visual confusion dilutes the power of the scene . there are too many questions left unanswered with the character of kurtz to have a satisfying ending . the finest scene at the end is sheen \\' s escape , and his entrace into the temple . his rise out of the water , with the smoke coming off of his slicked head , is a brilliant 30 seconds of film . yet , you cannot shake the feeling that there is so much more this film could have done . the psychotic ride is unforgettable at times , and indeed the film on the whole is very good . it is a stunningly flawed expression of film , for it addresses major issues , such as man \\' s mental stamina during bouts of war . but one still cannot shake the feeling that this film could have so much more powerful , had the character of kurtz been more explored , and had sheen truly succumbed to the fate that the viewer thought he was destined for . there is too much good material in here not to be called a masterpiece , but it could have been so much more rewarding .',\n",

              " ('hong kong cinema has been going through a bad spell . the last few productions have been effect laded action adventures that combine both the best and worst of american filmmaking with the same qualities of hong kong films . in a nutshell , the current crop of films from hong kong has been maddeningly convoluted and visually sumptuous . with the one time british colony reverting back to mainland ownership , a lot of hong kong \\' s best talents have crossed the pacific to work on u . s . productions . such talents as jackie chan ( rush hour ) , chow yun - fat ( anna & the king , the corrupter ) and yuen woo - ping ( the matrix ) have all moved into the budget bloated world of hollywood filmmaking with mixed results . now we can add two other hong kong filmmakers to the mix with star jet li and director and fight choreographer corey yuen kwai . unfortunately \" romeo must die \" bears all the trademarks of a typical hollywood action film and none of hong kong \\' s rhythms . the film opens in a nightclub as an asian couple is necking . enter a group of chinese gangsters led by kai sing ( russell wong ) . kai confronts po sing ( jon kit lee ) , the son of kai \\' s boss and leader of the local chinese family . a battle breaks out between the bodyguards of the club and kai , who handily kicks and punches his opponents down . it \\' s not until club owner silk ( rapper dmx ) , bears down on kai and his henchmen that the fight ends . the following morning po sing is found dead . suspicions escalate , as issac o \\' day ( delroy lindo ) is told of the murder . his concern that the war between his and the chinese family may explode and ruin his plans to move out of the business of corruption and into a legitimate venture . issac implores his chief of security , mac ( issiah washington ) to watch after his son and daughter . the scene shifts to a prison in china , where han sing ( jet li ) learns of his brothers murder . he fights with the guards and is dragged off to be disciplined . hung upside down by one foot , han recovers and battle his way out of custody in a blistering display of fight choreography and stunt work . escaping to the u . s . han sets out to find the person responsible for his brother \\' s death . \" romeo must die \" is in many ways a fun film . it is both absurd and assured . the basic plot of a gangster wanting to become legitimate echoes \" the godfather \" . the relationship between jet li \\' s han and aaliyah \\' s trish o \\' day reminds us of abel ferrera \\' s \" china girl \" , except that romeo must die \\' s couple never once exchange more than a loving glance towards one another . their romance is much more puritanical than any other romance in film history . the performances are adequate if not fully acceptable . li , of course has the showiest part , having to express both an innocents and steadfast determination . allayah , in her feature film debut manages to carry what little is asked of her with a certain style and grace . it \\' s obvious that the camera loves her and she is very photogenic . but , still the part is under written in such a way that even a poor performance would not have affected it . delro lindo as issac o \\' day carries himself well in the film . an unsung and under appreciated actor , mr . lindo turns out the films best performance . the other performers are all adequate in what the script asks of them except for d . b . woodside as issac \\' s son , colin . the performance is undirected , with the character changing his tone and demeanor in accordance with whatever location he is in . an unfocused performance that should have been reigned in and / or better written . first time director andrzej bartkowiak does a workmanlike job in handling the film . having a career as one of the industry \\' s best cinematographers , bartkiwiak knows how to set up his shots , and \" romeo must die \" does look good . but the pacing of the film is lethargic , only coming to a semblance of life during the fight scenes . the script by eric bernt and john jarrell is not focused in such a way that we can care about the characters or the situations they are in . the big gambit of buying up waterfront property to facilitate the building of a sports center for a nfl team is needlessly confusing . and of course the common practice of one character being the comic relief of the film becomes painfully obvious here as anthony anderson as allayah \\' s bodyguard , maurice has no comic timing whatsoever . the best things about the film are its fight scenes . jet li is a master of these intricate physical battles . one needs only to see his film \" fist of legend \" to understand that the man is without peer in the realm of martial art combat . here , jet is given the opportunity to show off in a way that \" lethal weapon 4 \" ( jet \\' s u . s . debut ) didn \\' t allow . unfortunately , a lot of jet \\' s fights are aided with computer effects that detract from his ability and precision . also \" romeo must die \" must be noted as having the most singularly useless effect ever committed to film , and that is an x - ray effect that appears three times during the course of the film , showing the effect of bone crushing blows on an opponent . obviously a homage to the famed x - ray scene from sonny chiba \\' s \" streetfighter \" , the scenes here are just pointless and interfere with the pacing of the film . it \\' s as if the film has stopped and a video game has been inserted . one problem though about the fight scenes . those that are familiar with hong kong action know that even though the films are fantasies and are as removed from reality as any anime or cartoon . they do have an internal rhythm to them . a heartbeat , so to speak in their choreography . the fight scenes in a hong kong film breath with an emotional resonance . this is created by the performance , the direction and the editing . here in \" romeo must die \" , there is no staccato . every fight scene , even though technically adroit and amazing becomes boring as the editing both cuts away from battle at hand and simple follows a set pattern . the rhythm is monotonous . a hong kong film has a tempo that changes , heightening its emotional impact . \\' rmd \\' is limited to a standard 4 / 4 tempo , not allowing for any emotional content whatsoever . a fine example of this difference can be found by examining a couple of jackie chan \\' s films . . watch the restaurant fight from the film \" rush hour \" and notice that the context of the fight , while technically amazing is rather flat ( the framing and cut always do not help ) . now look at the warehouse fight from \" rumble in the bronx \" . there you have a heartbeat , and emotional draw that doesn \\' t let the audience catch its breath . the stops and pauses for dramatic effect work perfectly , causing the viewer to be both astounded and flabbergasted . here in \\' romeo must die \\' , the fight scenes have no more emotional content or character than any john wayne barroom brawl . jet li is a grand and personable screen presence . it \\' s a shame that his full talents were not used to full effect here . one day filmmakers here in the u . s . will stop making films by the numbers and start to embrace the style and emotion that has made hong kong action pictures such a commodity . until then , we \\' ll be left with emotionally hollow product like \" the replacement killer \" and , currently \" romeo must die \" .',\n",

              " ('scream 2 , like its predecessor , is a genre - crossing film . it is about 50 % horror film and 50 % murder mystery . the mix worked very well last time and it continues to entertain this time . scream was also known for its self - referential tone . many inside jokes were made in reference to horror movies and wes craven . again , scream 2 follows suit with characters saying such things as \" sequels suck \" and \" the entire horror genre was destroyed by sequels . \" scream 2 \\' s story is very similar to it \\' s predecessor \\' s . sidney ( neve campbell ) , having survived the killing spree in scream , is now in college . gale weathers ( courteney cox ) has written a book about the murders and that book is now being released as a feature film , called stab ( which for all practical purposes is the real - world movie scream ) . at the premiere of stab , two students from sidney \\' s college are stabbed to death , and a new story begins . the press descends on sidney and her college to get the scoop on this sequel killer . they want to know all about the links between stab , sidney , and the recent murders . the most complex self - reference i saw ( this should be an olympic event ) was the scene where gale weathers was asking questions at a press conference . the rest of the press was watching and videotaping weathers . the other survivors from scream were watching and videotaping the press . the audience was watching the whole , filmed scene . ( whew . ) the movie is packed with layers and self - references that make it a pleasure to watch . even better would be to watch a double feature of scream and scream 2 . that \\' s not to say that these references necessarily make scream 2 a deep , or even a good movie . the just add to the fun of watching it . i recommend it for other reasons as well . what i liked best about the horror aspect of the movie is that the monster is not supernatural . no werewolf or ghost or psycho with superhuman strength is responsible . it is a person in a mask and a robe , his only advantage the fear he strikes into his victims . no extraordinary leap of faith is needed to believe in the killer . the down side is that if you are frightened by horror movies , you have less grounds to say \" it \\' s just a movie . \" the whodunit aspect of the movie is not that great by itself - gale weathers and deputy dewey ( david arquette , also from the original ) track down a killer . they are likeable , but not outstanding . but in combination with the horror aspect , the whodunit is a perfect counterpoint . it was exactly a year ago today that i wrote the review for scream . the internet movie database says that scream 3 is in the works , so i wonder if i \\' ll be doing the same thing on january 1 , 1999 . if craven and screenwriter kevin williamson are able to keep the quality high , i \\' ll be happy to mark my calendar .',\n",

              " ('titanic is , without a doubt , the best movie i \\' ve seen all year . and believe me , i \\' m not an easy critic to impress : the english patient was too long , men in black was over - hyped , and several of the \" big summer releases \" were dead in the water . thank god this film got delayed until december . it \\' s my christmas present . titanic is in the tradition of the old hollywood epics of years - gone - by , and it is truly a stunning film . while watching this picture you are completely mesmerized , never taking your eyes off the screen , nor checking your watch to see how much longer it \\' s gonna last , despite its 3 hour plus running time . as a friend of mine , who \\' s a true titanic - buff , said \" if someone doesn \\' t like this film , it \\' s because they didn \\' t want to . \" truer words are hard to come by . of course , it doesn \\' t hurt that this film comes from one of my favorite directors , james cameron , who is unarguably the greatest action director of all time . if you wish to argue that point with me , look at his list of credits : the terminator , aliens , the abyss , terminator 2 , true lies , etc . still care to disagree ? not only has cameron helmed the directorial duties of this film , he also wrote , produced , and edited it . and to show his true faith for the project , he renenged all directing fees and percentage points to ease the budget costs . it \\' s obvious he truly loves titanic . the film opens with footage , both real and fake , of an underwater excursion by special submarines to the bottom of the atlantic , where a team of explorers lead by bill paxton are searcing for a diamond called the \" heart of the ocean \" , which , according to bill paxton \\' s character , would be worth more than the hope diamond today . their search turns up , dissapointly , no diamond , but instead a drawing of a young woman wearing the diamond . this picture is broadcast on cnn and is seen by a 101 year old woman named rose , who claims to be the girl in the picture . she is flown out to sea to meet bill paxton and to tell them about the diamond . almost all of the rest of the movie is her narration of the past . rose \\' s narration shows us how she was an unhappy young girl , engaged to a rich man named cal hockley ( billy zane ) that she didn \\' t want to marry . her mother is pushy and obnoxious , and cal hockley is arrogant . they are boarding the titanic , which is sailing to america , and this is where she is to marry cal . meanwhile , a young man named jack dawson ( leonardo dicaprio ) and his italian friend ( danny nucci ) win two 3rd class tickets aboard the titanic in a poker game . they are overjoyed , and rush aboard just as the boat is leaving . for them , this is their ticket to america , to a better life . for rose , she is sailing to her doom . the first hour and a half or so of titanic tells the story of how rose dewitt ( kate winslet ) and jack dawson fall in love . it \\' s the classic wrong - side - of - the - tracks story , and does sometimes resort to a few cliches . but as i said above , the love portion isn \\' t sappy and doesn \\' t \" weigh the film down \" , as some critics have said . it \\' s sweet , and it didn \\' t make me restless at all , despite the fact that i usually hate love stories . of course , it might help that cameron introduces some pretty interesting characters to help keep our eyes glued to the screen . most of these people actually were passengers on the titanic back in 1912 , including the enigmatic molly brown ( played by the talented kathy bates ) , the captain of titanic ( bernard hill ) , and so on . all of these characters add an extra depth to the film , and make it that easier to watch . of course , things really start to get going after the hour and a half mark , where the titanic strikes the iceberg and begins a slow sink to the bottom . the sinking is depicted realisticly , and the effects are truly amazing . it is not told in a heroic fashion sense either , as people are portrayed as panicking , pushing others aside to get on the limited lifeboats , and drowning and dying horrible deaths . the best part of the movie , in my opinion , comes at the very end , when we flash back to the future . the crew , who at first had been skeptical of rose \\' s story , now are totally aborbed by her . rose goes out onto the ship \\' s ledge , and we then learn a secret about her that catches us off guard . we then see a dream of rose \\' s , in which she returns to the titanic and is dancing with jack dawson . most people i talked with after the movie saw this as only a dream . however , i think it symbolized more ; i think it meant that rose had died , and is going to a sort of heaven , which would be the happiest part of her life : her and her one true love , jack . if anyone has seen the movie and would like to voice an opinion about this , e - mail me at venom8 @ hotmail . com .',\n",

              " ('\" the 44 caliber killer has struck again . \" starring john leguizamo , mira sorvino , adrian brody , jennifer esposito , michael rispoli , bebe neuwirth . rated r . summer of sam will be remembered as a waste of spike lee \\' s abilities . lee is a great filmmaker , often exhibiting kinetic visual flair on par with brian depalma and martin scorsese and a storytelling ability comparable to steven spielberg . but here , he gets himself into a bind . his latest effort is a case of a director pretending he has something to say when in reality there is little of substance to absorb from his work . the summer of 1977 was an unusual summer in new york city . it was the hottest summer on record . to boot , new york \\' s first serial killer was on the loose : calling himself the son of sam , david berkowitz killed 9 people in the new york area and frightened the whole city population . so it was understandable that when nyc was hit with a citywide blackout , people went berserk , causing billions of dollars in damage to the city . the movie \\' s focus is on a group of twenty - somethings during that fateful summer : vinny ( john leguizamo ) , a club - hopping , adultrous hairdresser , his benevolent wife dionna ( mira sorvino , looking young ) , ritchie ( adrian brody ) , a punk who becomes an outcast as well as a son of sam suspect , a gang of small time mobsters and a few more minor characters . we follow them through their roller coaster lives , thrown out of whack even more by the recent killings . vinny and dionna have marital problems because vinny cheats and dionna tries to please him , make him stay faithful to her . ritchie gets shunned by his group of friends because he has started to become more and more \" eccentric , \" and has degenerated to the point of dancing in gay night clubs and making porno films with his girlfriend . tensions build and conflicts arise as the anniversary night of son of sam \\' s first murder looms ; the night he promises he will strike again . a local gang with too much time on its hands makes a list detailing all of the people that its members think might be suspects . at the top of the list is ritchie . vinny , an unwilling part of the said group , is called upon to set a trap for his friend . as we watch these proceedings , some of which are painfully graphic , the dreaded \" so what ? \" question springs to mind . from the way this movie is made , i \\' d have guessed that spike lee was trying to tell us something , but as i searched deeper it became clear that there is very little there to find . lee touches on so much -- the media , the 70 \\' s punk scene , the details of the actual killings , as well as the characters \\' very personal dilemmas -- but he doesn \\' t bring all of his topics together to form a coherent theme or make a discernible statement . all is not lost if a movie turns out to be hollow ; it can be a saving grace for the film to be enjoyable . too bad summer of sam doesn \\' t get any help here . frankly , it \\' s a bore , a redundant and repetitive two hour and twenty minute film that doesn \\' t entertain beyond its first half hour . there is no suspense because the film refuses to be fully about the murders and little involving drama because the film is too muddled and its focus too vague . leguizamo \\' s turn as vinnie is annoying and whiny . the script makes it clear that we \\' re supposed to believe that his character is flawed , but still a good guy . you \\' d never guess from his performance . adrian brody and especially mira sorvino fare better . sorvino gives a riveting , touching performance in a banal movie ( i \\' m tempted to think that i liked her because nearly everything else around her was inane ) ; her character is affecting and her emotions true - to - heart . brody , too paints an effective portrait of a young guy desperate for attention who gets a little more than he bargained for . summer of sam has some superficial elements of a good film : it looks great , it has a few notable performances and i suppose it \\' s pretty well directed , in a purely technical way . but it \\' s also empty , pretentious and boring . like last year \\' s the thin red line , it \\' s a movie by a director who doesn \\' t know what he wants to say but goes ahead and says it anyway . ? 1999 eugene novikov &# 137 ;',\n",

              " ('note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . be forewarned . during the three years since the release of the groundbreaking success pulp fiction , the cinematic output from its creator , quentin tarantino , has been surprisingly low . oh , he \\' s been busy -- doing the talk show circuit , taking small roles in various films , overseeing the production of his screenplay from dusk till dawn , making cameo appearances on television shows , providing a vignette for the ill - fated anthology four rooms -- everything , it seems , except direct another feature - length film . it \\' s been the long intermission between projects as well as the dizzying peak which pulp fiction reached which has made mr . tarantino \\' s new feature film , jackie brown , one of the most anticipated films of the year , and his third feature film cements his reputation as the single most important new american filmmaker to emerge from the 1990s . things aren \\' t going well for jackie brown ( pam grier ) . she \\' s 44 years old , stuck at a dead - end job ( \" $ 16 , 000 a year , plus retirement benefits that aren \\' t worth a damn \" ) as a flight attendant for the worst airline in north america -- and she \\' s just been caught at the airport by atf agent ray nicolette ( portrayed with terrific childlike enthusiasm by michael keaton ) and police officer mark dargus ( michael bowen ) smuggling $ 50 000 from mexico for gun - runner ordell robbie ( samuel l . jackson ) , who has her bailed out by unassuming bail bondsman max cherry ( robert forster ) . the loquacious ordell , based out of a hermosa beach house where his horny , bong - hitting surfer girl melanie ( bridget fonda ) and agreeable crony louis gara ( robert de niro ) hang out , operates under the policy that the best rat is a dead rat , and he \\' s soon out to silence jackie brown . meanwhile , the authorities \\' target is ordell , and they want jackie to help them by arranging a sting to the tune of a half - million dollars . only through a series of clever twists , turns , and double - crosses will jackie be able to gain the upper hand on both of her nemeses . although jackie brown marks mr . tarantino \\' s first produced screenplay adaptation ( based on the elmore leonard novel \" rum punch \" ) , there \\' s no mistaking his distinctive fingerprints all over this film . while he \\' s adhered closely to the source material in a narrative sense , the setting has been relocated to los angeles and the lead character \\' s now black . in terms of ambiance , the film harkens back to the 1970s , from the wall - to - wall funk and soul music drowning the soundtrack to the nondescript look of the sets -- even the opening title credit sequence has the echo of vintage 1970s productions . the opening sequence featuring ms . grier wordlessly striding through the lax , funky music blaring away on the speakers , is emblematic of films of that era . the timeframe for the film is in fact 1995 , but the atmosphere of jackie brown is decidedly retro . of course , nothing in the film screams 1970s more than the casting of pam grier and robert forster as the two leads , and although the caper intrigue is fun to watch as the plot twists , backstabbing , and deceptions deliciously unfold , the strength of jackie brown is the quiet , understated relationship developed between jackie and max ; when they kiss , it \\' s perhaps the most tender scene of the year . tenderness ? in a quentin tarantino film ? sure , there \\' ve been moments of sweetness in his prior films -- the affectionate exchanges between the bruce willis and maria de madeiros characters in pulp fiction and the unflagging dedication shared by the characters of tim roth and amanda plummer , or even in reservoir dogs , where a deep , unspoken bond develops between the harvey keitel and tim roth characters -- but for the most part , mr . tarantino \\' s films are typified by manic energy , unexpected outbursts of violence , and clever , often wordy , banter . these staples of his work are all present in jackie brown , but what \\' s new here is a different facet of his storytelling -- a willingness to imbue the film with a poignant emotional undercurrent , and a patience to draw out several scenes with great deliberation . this effective demonstration of range prohibits the pigeonholing of mr . tarantino as simply a helmer of slick , hip crime dramas with fast - talking lowlifes , and heralds him as a bonafide multifaceted talent ; he \\' s the real deal . this new aspect of mr . tarantino \\' s storytelling is probably best embodied in a single character -- that of the world - weary , sensitive , and exceedingly - professional max cherry , whose unspoken attraction to jackie is touching . mr . forster \\' s nuanced , understated performance is the best in the film ; he creates an amiable character of such poignancy that when he gazes at jackie , we smile along with him . much press has been given about the casting of blaxploitation - era icon pam grier in the lead , with the wags buzzing that mr . tarantino may do for her what his pulp fiction did to bolster john travolta \\' s then - sagging career . as it turns out , ms . grier is solid in the film \\' s title role , although nothing here forces her to test her range . i do have to take exception to the claim that this film marks her career resurrection , though -- she \\' s been working steadily over the years , often in direct - to - video action flicks , but also in such recent theatrical releases as tim burton \\' s mars attacks ! and larry cohen \\' s original gangstas ( where she first teamed up with mr . forster . ) of course , it \\' s true that her role here was a godsend -- a meaty a part as this is rarity for * any * actress , let alone one of her age and current status in the industry . while jackie brown may disappoint those looking for another pulp fiction clone , it marks tremendous growth of mr . tarantino as a director whose horizons are rapidly expanding , and whose characterizations have never been better . and while the film \\' s narrative doesn \\' t really warrant a running time of 155 minutes , it \\' s filled with such sumptuous riches , ranging from the brashness of the vivid soundtrack to entertaining , inconsequential conversations between the characters , that there wasn \\' t an unengaging moment . with an impressive trio of feature films under his belt , it \\' ll be interesting to see what he tries next .',\n",

\" ohh ohh ee - tarzan - ee ee ohh ? \" well , regardless of my picky nature , the romance actually works as only disney romance can : purely contrived , but for some reason rather believable . but hey , tarzan \\' s a young adult . do you think he dated a few of the female apes before meeting jane ? isn \\' t that illegal in most countries ? oh , well . i don \\' t think disney will be using my quote anymore . tarzan departs from the usual disney feature in that this one is not a musical . there \\' s lots of music to be sure , but not a single character song in the whole hour and a half of running time . we instead get more of a phil collins concert , as no less than five of his original songs are used as interlude material . this isn \\' t really a bad thing , as the songs are very high - energy and catchy ( i found myself singing one to myself for most of the following day ) ; it \\' s just different . do yourself a favor and see this film in a theater with a good sound system , because the music will come through astonishingly well and really enhance the movie . with each new feature , disney animation gets even better . not necessarily by leaps and bounds , but since they put out a new film each year , a steady rate of improvement is apparent , and this definitely shows in tarzan . there are a couple of scenes where the animation achieves a near 3 - d effect , and a number of scenes which feature tarzan moving through the trees are absolutely dizzying . the way he slides down tree limbs and trunks is very reminiscent of skateboarding and rollerblading maneuvers , and had me thinking this isn \\' t just tarzan , it \\' s \" extreme tarzan . \" however , tarzan does not seem to have what i call its \" chandelier scene , \" which is the one scene to which the animators have chosen to devote an inordinate amount of effort , utilizing a computer - assisted process that makes the animation absolutely breathtaking . lasting but a few seconds at most , it \\' s been the signature of nearly every disney animated feature since beauty and the beast , in which the castle ballroom chandelier was rendered in stunning detail . as usual , the voice talent is up to snuff , convincingly make you believe in the convictions of animated characters . the one poor choice in casting , however , was rosie o \\' donnell . going into the film , i didn \\' t know she was even a part of it , but when terk started talking , i recognized her voice immediately . her performance was fine , but through the rest of the film i kept thinking , \" that \\' s no boy ape , that rosie o \\' donnell . \" distracting to say the least . i \\' ll admit i \\' ve never read the edgar rice burroughs story \" tarzan of the apes , \" so i couldn \\' t tell you how true this film stays to the book . but unless you \\' re a purist , you should have few objections to this film . with solid performances , action , adventure , a bit of romance , and great music and animation , tarzan should appeal to the kids and to the kid in all of us . note : when i wrote my review of mulan a year ago , i went off on the promotional and merchandising tie - ins prevalent with the release of a disney animated feature . this time , i \\' ll just say that i went to mcdonald \\' s yesterday to treat myself to a mcflurry , and tarzan was on the cup . \\' nuff said .',\n",

              " (\"note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . be forewarned . milos forman ' s first film since the ill - fated valmont , columbia ' s the people vs . larry flynt , is a vastly entertaining ( if not particularly enlightening ) biopic of hustler publisher and self - made millionaire larry flynt , who became an unlikely champion of freedom of speech rights in the united states in the late 1970s and early 1980s . the film unweaves its tale in a chronological order : we open with young and dirt - poor larry flynt and his brother jimmy , peddling jars of water in true entrepreneurial spirit out in the rural outback of kentucky . cut to forward in time , where the two flynt brothers , now young men , are running the struggling hustler go - go clubs in cincinnati . the strip clubs are in a dire financial state , and in a last - ditch effort to salvage the operations , flynt decides to go to a print shop and churn out a promotional newsletter . this evolved into the adult periodical _hustler_ magazine , creating larry flynt a vast financial empire , and the rest is history . what sets flynt apart from other publishers is his struggles against those who would have him cease publication of his adult material , and who railed and preached against him - flynt spent time in incarceration and was paralyzed by an assassination attempt - and his driven , single - minded insistence to buck the system and fight for his freedom of expression , regardless of personal cost . the people vs . larry flynt also weaves in the bittersweet story of flynt ' s true love , althea leasure , whom he meets as a dancer in his club and later marries , and who devotedly stands alongside him throughout his trials and tribulations . considering the serious nature of the film ' s theme - the importance of the united states ' first amendment - the people vs . larry flynt is surprisingly and wonderfully light - hearted and humourous . much of the comedy is elicited from larry flynt ' s outlandish stunts at his courtroom appearances - some of his chosen apparel is hilarious - and for the most part these elements of the film work far better than some of the more dramatic points , such as an uninspiring flynt monologue set at a free speech rally in front of an enormous american flag dealing with the subjectivity of obscenity . the film ' s focus is on the flynt ' s many battles over first amendment rights and freedom of speech , but the heart of the people vs . larry flynt is the touching love story between flynt and althea . larry flynt is shown as being occassionally gruff , harsh , and overtly aggressive with his friends and colleagues , but with althea , we see his loving , affectionate side . there ' s a scene where flynt tenderly takes his ill wife on a ride on his wheelchair that is heartbreaking . ultimately , the emotional power that the film hits at its conclusion comes not from his achievements from his battles against censors , but from the strength of flynt and althea ' s love for each other . woody harrelson is entirely engaging in what must be certainly a career - topping performance as the irrepressible larry flynt . harrelson plays flynt with the right mixture of outrageousness and confident stubborness to make him endearing and entirely sympathetic to the audience , and a very compelling protagonist for the film . courtney love plays althea leasure in a startling turn , completely raw and impulsive . it ' s a very solid performance , brash and naturalistic , and love is extremely compelling ; it ' s difficult to take your eyes off her onscreen , and her chemistry with harrelson is dead - on . edward norton , as flynt ' s straight , level - headed lawyer is often upstaged by his flashier co - stars in the people vs . larry flynt , much as his counterpart lawyer alan isaacman was upstaged by flynt during many of the courtroom scenes , but norton shines in his big scene where he addresses the supreme court in the climactic scene of the film . one can sense the frustration that norton ' s character feels when harrelson ' s free - talking flynt sabotages trial after trial on him by openly speaking his mind , and this results in a heightened emotional punch when norton ' s isaacman has the opportunity to sway the supreme court judges . milos forman keeps the film moving - although it runs over two hours , it never drags - and his direction of the film is very effective , eliciting a great deal of empathy for a subject which could be construed by some as extremely sordid and unsympathetic . there ' s also a great visual technique which forman uses to indicate the passing of time in one shot , which is both clever and extremely entertaining . two minor quibbles with the film - it certainly seems like the people vs . larry flynt is in a rush to get to its main theme , with flynt battling against authorities and the system for his freedom of speech . consequently , the first thirty minutes of the film , introducing and setting up the characters , seem unduly rushed ; perhaps it is merely due to the fact that these characters are so interesting , but i felt it would have worked better if this route was taken in a more leisurely fashion . it also felt like there was a distinctive lack of insight into the inner workings of these characters - the film clearly shows what flynt , althea , isaacman , and rev . jerry faldwell did , and on a superficial level some of their motivations , but it never seemed like one could really understand the characters on a deeper level . for example , why larry flynt was compelled by ruth carter stapleton ( president carter ' s sister ) to be born - again is a mystery to me . then again , perhaps it was to him as well . these two points don ' t detract greatly from the film . the people vs . larry flynt is certainly among the very best studio - released films of 1996 , and works both as a ringing political statement about the importance of freedom of speech and the depths to which larry flynt would go to advance the cause of free expression , and as a touching love story .\",\n",

              " ('my opinion on a film can be easily swayed by the presence of actors i love . i love ralph fiennes . i love uma thurman . i love sean connery . hell , i \\' m even a big fan of jim broadbent and fiona shaw . i saw the fantastic preview for the avengers nearly eight months ago , and i \\' ve been eagerly awaiting the film ever since . a few months into the summer , however , i noticed that its release date had been changed a few times , and that it had ended up in the mid - august dumping ground . then , in this final week before its official release , i learned that it was not to be screened for critics . and that the actors had not been plugging the film on late night programs . and that it was directed by the same man who brought us the remake of diabolique . my expectations fell to pieces when i learned all of these things . the film i saw today didn \\' t even meet those expectations . this is a lousy , incoherent mess . i would slam it harder , if it weren \\' t for the nifty sets and the mere presence of all these fine , lovable actors . but sets are ultimately empty , and the performances are completely uninspired . that \\' s the main problem with the avengers : for all it \\' s hip - hop flash and tidal waves , none of it feels the least bit energetic or inspired . it \\' s like a chore , a bland exercise in superhero film making . it also feels like its been cut to pieces , clocking in at 90 minutes and forgetting to close some of its own subplots . this is just plain depressing . the avengers is a film version of the popular 60s television show . frequent readers of mine will not be surprised to learn that i \\' ve never watched an episode . i wasn \\' t alive then . i don \\' t even watch television now . i \\' m very sorry that i don \\' t have this perspective , but , judging from the reviews i \\' ve already read , knowing the tv show just makes matters worse . i didn \\' t know and love john steed and emma peel , and therefore i was not as upset to see how these actors i love have managed to thrash their roles . i also doubt that familiarity with the series would allow me to understand more clearly the chain of events that do take place in this film . based on what the film told me , i gather that steed ( fiennes ) is some kind of british super guy ( somewhat like james bond ) , and that dr . peel ( thurman ) is just a really smart doctor , who also happens to know a lot about weather and about beating people up while limited by tight leather suits . they are to work together , under mother \\' s orders ( mother is played by jolly jim broadbent , while his co - conspirator , father , is played by the equally - talented fiona shaw ) . it seems that there is a man out there controlling the weather . his name is de wynter ( connery ) . he is a crazy scottish guy . our heroes had better stop him , or else . . . the weather will keep getting colder until they \" have to go to hell to warm up \" ( one of the film \\' s few funny lines ) . along the way there is subplot after subplot , hinged sloppily together by scenes that go nowhere , feel perfunctory , and ultimately make no sense . for example , our heroes are eventually attacked by a swarm of giant mechanical insects with machineguns attached to their torsos . now , killer bugs don \\' t really go with the weather - controlling theme of the film . the purpose of the bugs , other than to annihilate our heroes , is never established . they \\' re never even directly connected to de wynter ( they \\' re controlled by his crazy henchman , played by eddie izzard ) . the special effects aren \\' t bad , but they \\' re loud , obnoxious , and intrusive . like so many scenes in the film , it seems present only to keep your attention from waning . and i guarantee you , it will wane . i stopped thinking about the story when i realized it didn \\' t do any good to think . the avengers has clearly been chopped up and re - assembled so many times that even the people involved couldn \\' t tell us what happens . there are several scenes in the preview that didn \\' t make the final cut . in addition , many of the sequences have irritating , grainy film quality , which makes it feel low - budget ( the last scene is particularly bad ) . the scenes that don \\' t feature action should be electric , thanks to our wonderful cast . they aren \\' t . the action scenes should be electric , because this is an action film . they aren \\' t , either . and what about this wasted cast ? oh , it makes me weep with disappointment . we \\' re talking ralph fiennes here , one of the best actors working today , one of the best actors * ever * . i love the guy . i \\' ve loved all his films , until this one . he seems like he wants to understand the film , but he \\' s as lost as we are . and thurman , in all of her spectacular beauty and talent , can \\' t manage to look at home here . ( i don \\' t blame her completely , for there is a strange subplot involving her evil twin that is never explained in any way , and it can \\' t be easy to deal with such terrible screenwriting . ) connery , however , seems the most out of it , totally lacking any kind of focus , or interest , for that matter . who is to blame ? is it the screenwriter , don macpherson ? perhaps , although i can see a shell of a story here that could have been a good superhero movie had it been handled right . is it the actors ? for god \\' s sake , no -- these people clearly lost interest when they saw the inevitable path of destruction on which this film was travelling . i blame director jeremiah chechik , who shouldn \\' t have been given the task to begin with . his best film , benny & joon , is quirky in the same way that this one was supposed to be , but here it mostly seems like a lot of failed attempts at wit and humor . add to that a lack of experience in big - budget action , and you have the worst choice for director this side of james ivory . if the avengers has a saving grace , it \\' s the set design . the sets ( by stuart craig ) are big , colorful , and often pleasing to look at . i like the final set - piece , on de wynter \\' s island , even if none of it makes a bit of sense . i admired the overhead view of the stairs , showing dr . peel running around in circles and never getting anywhere . i also enjoyed michael kamen \\' s music score , particularly in the opening credits . but this stuff is routine -- good sets and music are nice , but there \\' s a lot more that needs to be here . inspiration , for instance , would have been really nice . maybe a little bit of cohesion in the story . or a sense of purpose . most of all , though , i would have liked to see these actors relish in their roles . damn this movie for not giving them the chance .',\n",

              " ('note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . be forewarned . among my fanatical ticker tape - worshipping friends , there \\' s one who happens to share the same philosophy espoused by the central character in darren aronofsky \\' s darkly original pi : the entire stock market can be reduced to nothing but a series of patterns which , through analysis , will produce information to accurately forecast future behaviour . ( an example of the mentality involved : if the stock price goes up like this , and then down like that , and then sharply up this way , it then will go * this * way . ) while i freely admit that i know less than nothing about the market ( knowledge check : prices up -- good ; prices down -- bad ; most of the time , at least ) and hence really couldn \\' t comment with any authority , it \\' s always nonetheless struck me as an incredibly naive oversimplification of an astonishingly complex system ( and besides , if it were that simple , no doubt somebody would \\' ve already figured it all out ) . the difference in this case is that while my colleague ( an otherwise assuredly realistic individual ) truly believes in this in and of itself as a valid forecaster , pi uses this ideology as a device with which to investigate its character \\' s psychosis . it \\' s also vastly more convincing with its argument . \" mathematics is the language of the universe , \" insists genius protagonist maximillian cohen ( sean gullette ) in a cool , mantra - like voice - over which repeats throughout the picture . since nature can be expressed in numbers , and there are patterns everywhere in nature , he reasons with eminent logic that finding the patterns will allow him to predict anything -- the ups and downs of the stock market , how many games the yankees will win this year , the flavour of jam i \\' m going to put on my toast tomorrow morning . obsessed with finding the proverbial key to the universe , max lives in paranoid , self - imposed solitude in a seedy nyc chinatown apartment , single - mindedly toiling away with his monstrous homemade computer system . sullenly withdrawn and plauged by debilitating migraines , the elusive pursuit of a mysterious 216 - digit number his machine spits out one day is driving him into madness . the story , then , is basically an eccentricity , but it \\' s a clever , astute eccentricity , perceptively zeroing in on the modern mistrust of mathematical reductionism ; in an age where a dominant societal phobia is one \\' s individualism being replaced by a series of numeric identifiers , max \\' s all - consuming penchent for numbers at once creates a lingering , unsettling mood . it helps matters that he \\' s not a particularly likable protagonist . all attempts of friendliness from neighbours are curtly rebuffed by max , a spindly , neurotic - looking individual who hasn \\' t the time to indulge in pleasantries . for a film which puts its lead character front and center ( mr . gullette appears in virtually every scene ) , pi takes a refreshing and effective approach in avoiding conventional aesthetics ; because of our ambivalence with max , we \\' re not so much avidly rooting for him to triumph with a moment of epiphany as we \\' re following him through this plot with a sense of mixed dread and morbid fascination -- it \\' s more disturbing journey than quest . still , we do care about max \\' s fate . teetering on the edge of dementia , he winds up being pursued by two different groups which want to pick his brain , both fronted by deliciously perky , resolutely cheerful representatives with inevitably duplictious intentions . as we know , in films where paranoia is a dominant element ( see the truman show \\' s laura linney character ) , or for that matter , in real life , it \\' s always the ones who never stop smiling at you and are overly friendly that are the ones of which to be wary . pi , a film that addresses patterns , itself intentionally adheres to an identifiable pattern cycle -- headache scene ; important revelation or bit of plot development ; pill - popping montage ; hallucinatory nightmare ( with decidedly cronenberg - esque undertones -- few other directors are as equally adept in bridging unsettling concepts and body - themed horror ) ; nosebleeding reality . the repetitiveness , far from being tedious , is effectively maddening ; more than anything , the picture aims to get under our skins and take in events from max \\' s claustrophobic perspective . in this regard , it wildly succeeds due to mr . aronofsky \\' s striking direction . it \\' s a rarity that a film so completely immerses itself into a protagonist \\' s warped perspective of his surrounding , and high contrast black - and - white cinematography combined with constant usage of extreme close - ups lend a heightened sense of paranoia to the proceedings .

              " (\"near the end of 1996 , analysts remarked that the year would be the last in which disney would stand alone as the animation king . the following year , 1997 , saw the first sleeper entry into the genre from a studio other than the magic kingdom : twentieth century fox gave baronial russia to the masses in the form of anastasia . at best , that ' s all it was -- a sleeper hit , designed to surprise but not shake the industry . in 1998 , however , things have been decidedly different . there have been a number of pushes on disney ' s death grip on the market , and fifty - one weeks into ' 98 , a new champion has emerged . dreamworks ' the prince of egypt succeeds where all of the other conventionally animated products have failed . the other two contenders , warner brothers ' quest for camelot and disney ' s own annual entry , mulan , lacked inspiration and drive respectively . although camelot was borderline - abysmal , and can ' t really be considered a shot at the title , mulan had the makings of winner . unfortunately , it was saturated with traditional , disney - cute animation , and lost points against the rapidly - changing face of the competition . in making the prince of egypt , dreamworks has strayed from all of these hallmarks and created a genuinely unique product . the animation is flawless , and , aside from a bug ' s life , is the best - looking movie to date . the animators have nimbly mixed both flat and spatial effects , and the 2d / 3d combination is something that artists from disney and fox have heretofore struggled with . the key to success , however , was that the visuals were used not just because they looked cool but also as a method of advancing the plot . namely , some of the most important action sequences ( like the parting of the red sea ) were done almost entirely in 3d . dreamworks is the first studio to prove that they ' ve got the stuff of success , and that they ' re capable of challenging disney . the story is also well - written , and the characters voiced with talent . for the most part , the plot follows its source material -- the book of exodus -- although only in the most general sense . the writers took a few creative liberties , and most do not damage the story in any way . in fact , the shakespearean relationship between moses ( val kilmer ) and the pharaoh rameses ( ralph fiennes ) makes the story more interesting if anything . moses , a hebrew , is saved from the slaughter of the firstborn sons by his mother when she sets him in a basket on the nile ; he floats into the pharaoh seti ( patrick stewart ) ' s palace and is taken in by the royal family . moses grows up but learns of his heritage and flees into the desert , where he discovers the burning bush and is commissioned by god to return to egypt and free the slaves . by this time , rameses is now pharaoh , and the two brothers , now on opposite sides of the line , face off in a battle of wills and divine intervention . the cast of voices is most impressive , and also includes such noteables as sandra bullock , jeff goldblum , danny glover , and steve martin . the script does not have a lot of one - liners in it , and god is reduced to a voice that might well be mistaken for the same one that spoke to kevin costner in field of dreams , but overall the story is exciting and interesting . it ' s decidedly for an older crowd , and the tykes who haven ' t had a few years of religion class will be hopelessly lost . but for those who make the bid , the prince of egypt can be a great watch .\",\n",

because there is more . much , much more . and this is a movie that , without credits , is little over 90 minutes and feels only like an hour . \" the whole nine yards \" is an ultimately unsatisfying and empty - headed excursion into well - worn terrain already set by far superior pictures . how the cast , most of which are respectable actors , got caught up in such a cliched , deficient film remains a mystery , unless they thought it might aspire to match the congenial screwball zaniness of director lynn \\' s 1985 comedy classic , \" clue : the movie . \" going into the theater , preliminary comparisons between the two movies were unavoidable , but by the twenty - minute mark , when i had chuckled once and laughed nary a single time , it was clear this production was in serious trouble . since the entire running time depends on the mechanisms of the plot , and the screenplay , inauspiciously written by mitchell kapner , collapses with every failing \" comedy \" bit , the film is an inevitable dead zone in the way of substance and , frequently , entertainment value . \" the whole nine yards \" is neither facetious nor , aside from the subplot about jill \\' s shocking eagerness to become a professional hitwoman , inventive , and more often than not , just lies there , the film spinning drearily around and around in the projector , but never igniting any sort of spark . a few select actors do what they can with the material , while others make no impact at all . on the mediocre side are actually those playing the two central characters : matthew perry and bruce willis . perry , innocuously enjoyable on tv \\' s \" friends , \" plays the same exact sitcom - style character in all of his movies ( from 1997 \\' s \" fools rush in \" to 1999 \\' s \" three to tango \" ) , and it has become a crushing bore . meanwhile , willis makes next to no impression , and because of the limited guise of his jimmy \" the tulip \" tudeski , oftentimes disappears into the background . their three female counterparts fare noticeably better . best of all is natasha henstridge , far more radiant than in the exploitative \" species \" movies , who adds unanticipated depth and emotion to cynthia . henstridge has the talent , for sure , to break out of these countless throwaway roles , but first she must fire her agent . amanda peet has a lot of fun as the quirkily straightforward and giddy jill , and seems to know more about the art of comedic payoff than even perry who , thus far , has strived on a career based solely on comedy . it is too bad , then , that peet is unnecessarily asked to disrobe in a climactic scene , with the obvious sole purpose being to show off her breasts . finally , rosanna arquette is awful as sophie , but something tells me that was her purpose , and her clear overacting only aids in brightening up her limited screen time . also popping up is michael clarke duncan , fresh off an oscar nomination for his role in \" the green mile , \" as jimmy \\' s largely built friend and fellow killer , frankie figs . when \" the whole nine yards \" eventually sputters to its underwhelming conclusion , one is left pondering how such a film ever got greenlit . a great deal of movies of this type have been made in the past , and this one is nothing but a duplication of better films , so what was the point ? without a passable screenplay or any notable technical accomplishments , \" the whole nine yards \" rests solely on the presumed charm of the cast , and half of the actors are not charming at all . now , what does that tell you ?',\n",

up . the story takes place at the extravagant home of an aging patriarch ( henning mortizen ) , who has just turned 60 and is having a party thrown for him . all his friends and family turn up , and for the first half hour , we get introduced to everyone , simplistically and realistically ( no aggravatingly condescending posing for the camera deals here ) . the eldest son , christian ( ulrich thomsen , looking a bit like a young malcolm mcdowell ) , is the first to be seen in the film , walking to his father \\' s home . his brother , michael ( thomas bo larsen ) , drives by , pulls over , greets him , then kicks his family out of the car , forcing them to walk to the estate , just so christian can be comfortable . we then meet helene ( paprika steen ) , their sister , a woman who always seems to be stressed - out , who invites the driver of her car ( gbatokai dakinah ) , an american , to to come join her at the party she \\' s going to . once they \\' re all there and settled in , the party begins , and as custom , the eldest son has to make a speech to his dad , so christian stands up , at the head of the table , and reveals the film \\' s punchline : his father raped all his children at a young age . but since this is a family / friends affair , his confession becomes more detested than the supposed truth , and is simply brushed off despite his efforts , and what transpires is sorta like jerry springer crossed with jean renoir , and it \\' s all terribly interesting to watch . twists occur , and soon the film has taken on a nearly - farsical nature , but still seems realistic because the people involved really feel like they could reach such ends . the most notorious thing about this film , which has been getting the most notice , though , is that the director , thomas vinterberg has shot it in a completely awkward fashion . as a member of the danish filmmakers clan , dogme 95 , a group that has vowed to oppose \" the auteur concept , make - up , illusions , and dramaturgical predictability \" so that they may \" purge film so that once again the inner lives of the characters justify the plot . \" i have not seen \" breaking the waves , \" the other notable film by a member of this group ( lars von trier , to be exact ) , but \" the celebration \" works exquisitely in this department . it feels like reality , like you \\' re actually watching real people and not actors , and as a major pointer , has been shot on video . as a result , it looks more like the home movies you never dare shot of your family than an actual film , but always wanted to . we see key moments in people \\' s lives that they wouldn \\' t dare show to the world , and it captures the farscial comedy of life so accurately and acutely that this style , as ironically - showmanship as it really is , works perfectly for the nature of the film . the key , though , to this film , and the reason it \\' s not just a cool danish import , is because this film is not about revealing the truth as much as it is about the way people react to such an explosive truth . throughout the film , we see a completely realized debate over the truth and the effects it has on the lives of those who have learned to live with lies , a debate so three - dimensional that it could easily blow oliver stone and his the - truth - at - all - costs reasoning out of the water . of course it was not right for the father to rape his children , and of course , they couldn \\' t have fought back then , and of course this has created scarring suppression inside them . and yes , it \\' s thearapeutic for one to release the truth years later , when they know it could easily destroy the one who emotionally destroyed them earlier . but then again , the father , after all , is not a totally bad guy , and we can see the emotional complications that arise thanks to a performance by mortizen which is just so great and touching that while we do believe that he could have raped his children years earlier , we also see a man who has also learned to live with what he \\' s done , and deep down , feels true guilt that is only now beginning to surface . the final scene , involving mortizen and everyone else , is utterly devastating , thanks to him and thomsen , whose performance is utterly flawless and equally emotionally complex . everyone else is flawless as well - the actors never seem to be stepping into the shoes of their characters as much as they do walking comfortably in them . the actors or writers have not made the mistake to judge these characters in the slightest : there are no whites or blacks but instead all grays , exactly like life . as such , \" the celebration \" may be the one truly bizarro film of the year : a work of art so eerily close to reality that it \\' s utterly disturbing and utterly fascinating .',\n",

              " ('based on the 1960s tv series that i had never seen or heard of before this movie ( be happy , i won \\' t bore you with any lame and unnecessary comparisons ) , this film allows will smith to take a third stab at the independence day weekend box - office , after scoring huge successes with men in black ( 7 / 10 ) , directed by the same man who controlled this one , and independence day ( 6 / 10 ) . can you say . . . the third times not a charm ? plot : james west and artemus gordon are chosen by the president to find the man responsible for the kidnapping of the nation \\' s top scientists , and threatening to take over the united states within a week . critique : i did not laugh once during this entire picture . when you consider that this film is a part - comedy , that \\' s not a very good sign . i also did not tense up or particularly enjoy any of its unenergetic action sequences which provided me with little more than a few minutes time to think back to the lovely salma hayek scenes . when you consider that the other \" part \" of this film is geared as an action / adventure , i would say that this another negative sign . and when you consider that the first hour of the film was boring and a little slow , the story - line tired , reminiscent of swiss cheese and uninvolving , and the special effects interesting but worth very little inside a plot filled with lame one - liners , weak characterizations and an anti - climactic end , you pretty much have the gist of my impression of this \" big \" summer blockbuster . it blows . or as they say in french , \" eet blows \" . could it be that the script was crappy because it took four people to write it ? maybe . could it be that most of the special effects don \\' t show up until the last half hour , and even then , we don \\' t see anything that its trailers hadn \\' t already given away ? perhaps . or could it be that we have come to expect so much more from will smith and hollywood big - budget movies , that we cannot help but evaluate them on a scale onto their own ? naaaaaaah ! a bad movie is a bad movie . on a positive note , i could honestly say that i did very much enjoy the lovely performance by the adorable salma hayek , who seemed underused ( in my humble opinion ) , and lit up every bubbly scene that she was hardly in . branagh was also fun as the scenery - munching , over - the - top bad guy , but that \\' s pretty much where the entertainment - buck stopped . smith and kline were static at best , the plot full of holes , and the score insignificant and derivative of a dozen others . i would strongly advise anyone not to see this movie . then again , there is that one scene with the lovely salma hayek tied up in a cage . . . huh . . . oh yeah , but the rest of the movie sucked . little known facts about this film and its stars : will smith has starred in two of the ten all - time top grossing films worldwide : 1997 \\' s summer blockbuster men in black ( 7 / 10 ) , for which he also recorded the grammy - winning title song , and 1996 \\' s independence day ( 6 / 10 ) . he once turned down a scholarship to mit to pursue his singing career . kevin kline is a graduate of the juilliard school of drama , and has been married to the cute - as - a - button actress phoebe cates since 1989 . they have two kids together , greta simone and owen . one of the buildings that gets blown up in this film has \" kasdan \" written on it . lawrence kasdan is a director known to have worked with kevin on five of his movies , including the big chill , silverado , i love you to death , grand canyon and french kiss . salma hayek gave up a successful career as a major television star in latin america and moved to the united states to start over , even though she spoke no english . she made her feature film debut as an actress with a small role in allison anders \\' mi vida loca ( no , not the rickie martin video ! ) and played her first starring role in robert rodriguez \\' s desperado opposite antonio banderas . since then , she has made an appearance in each one of rodriguez \\' s films . she stands 5 \\' 2 \" , was born in southeast mexico , and the daughter of a lebanese father and a mexican mother . one of the actresses cast as branagh \\' s lovely but lethal beauties includes bail ling , a stage and screen star in her native china who was last seen starring opposite dick gere in red corner ( 7 / 10 ) . another is dutch - born frederique van der wal , who is one of the world \\' s most recognized supermodels , having graced the cover of cosmopolitan numerous times , as well as harper \\' s bazaar , vogue and mademoiselle .',\n",

              " (\"at the outset of swordfish , john travolta ' s gabriel shear is pontificating about the status of american cinema today . basically , he says , it boils down to a lack of imagination among the majority of writers . how ironic , as travolta seems to be describing his latest venture . swordfish is loud , violent and amoral . it has the audacity to justify murder and mayhem in the name of sustaining our way of life . and how does travolta ' s gabriel plan to do this ? by robbing billions from his own government and using the funds to out - terrorize terrorists . swordfish is a very cynical movie . it relies on an audience ' s perception of our leaders as ineffectual and duplicitous and on terrorists as non - human , faceless entities not worthy of compassion or consideration . the movie ' s plot is preposterous with enough illogical leaps that if the film ever slowed down , you ' d actually see how ridiculous it all is . this is a live - action road runner cartoon , moving so quickly that it ' s over before you can catch your breath to ask any reasonable questions . the storyline revolves around super hacker stanley jobson ( hugh jackman ) , recruited by gabriel to crack the government ' s computer codes so gabriel can gather billions for his anti - terrorist campaign . talk about whacked - out patriotism . my objections to swordfish are many . the body count is high , but that is expected in a movie of this sort . it ' s becoming a bore watching anonymous soldiers , police officers and government agents blown to bits . another example is the family dynamics between stanley , his 10 - year - old daughter and his ex - wife . stanley , though having served time in prison for hacking , is shown as a loving and caring father , forbidden by his ex to see his little girl . audience animosity is immediately created for his former spouse by showing her as a drinker and smoker who also sometimes stars in her new husband ' s adult films . thus when she is found murdered late in the movie , neither stanley nor his daughter are allowed any time to grieve . in fact , subconsciously , many in the audience are probably glad she was killed . then there is the sequence involving one of gabriel ' s henchman holding a gun to the head of stanley ' s daughter to coerce the hacker to download the key computer program for gabriel . children as pawns have become a most unwelcome clich ? in recent films . there is enough violence in the real world involving children without having to make them on - screen victims as well . yea , it ' s only make believe , but that doesn ' t mean you have to tolerate it . travolta is cool , deadly charming and flamboyant as the near - crazy gabriel . his character is reminiscent of his villainous characterizations in broken arrow and face / off . jackman looks dour through most of the proceedings . his only moment of any depth comes when he finally is able to create the worm to get inside the government database . his sense of joy and accomplishment is one any computer whiz can appreciate . halle berry is decorative and lovely as gabriel ' s assistant , while don cheadle is given little to do as the head fbi agent hunting gabriel . swordfish plays like a comic book with a larger - than - life character in gabriel . viewers align themselves with him despite their uncertainty if he is hero or villain . and maybe that is the movie ' s underlying flaw : there is no real hero to speak of , only those doing their upmost to survive . and that is not enough . this is one swordfish that should have been thrown back in the water .\",\n",

( for those of you who aren \\' t comic - geeks , wizard is basically to comics what car and driver is to cars , what the new yorker is to high society , what boy \\' s life is to boy scots . okay , that one was pretty pathetic . ) few people know this , but men in black is based on a very obscure comic book that was , while not honest - politician - rare , very hard to find . this was after the release of the high - grossing batman forever , and it said that tommy lee jones and chris o \\' donnell were being considered for the roles ( in the comic book , there were no black men in black . kind of weird , huh ? ) all i can say is , thank god they didn \\' t cast chris o \\' donnell . i know i can \\' t be the only person on the planet who thinks he \\' s an annoying , preppie little snot . . . sorry . my apologies to o \\' donnell fans . i actually had a 7th grade teacher who was a big comic collector and was set to buy some of the comics from him , anticipating rather craftily that , if the movie was a big hit , it would drive up the price of the comics rather nicely . he decided not to sell them to me , because they were \" innappropriate \" . hmm . . . . so now you \\' re probably wondering why i \\' ve wasted about 5 paragraphs with lame anecdotes from my junior high years . good question . i \\' ll move on to the movie now . as you probably already know , will smith and tommy lee jones ( agents k and j , respectively ) belong to a top secret agency known as divison 5 , or it \\' s nickname mib ( men in black . ) men in black is a reference to the black suits and sunglasses the agents wear , and they \\' re mission is to investigate reports of alien landings and keep the aliens under control while they \\' re here on earth . not to get too technical or spoil the plot for the 6 people in the world who haven \\' t seen this movie , but a basically - big - roach - type - bug lands in a redneck farmer \\' s yard , inhabits his body , and attempts to destroy the entire universe . not bad , eh ?

( some of the scenes with his father border on interesting , while heather matarazzo , who plays his sister , pushes phillippe off the screen . ) but he decides to envelop himself in the disco scene , and succumb to peer pressure and to drugs . why his \" friends \" push him into drugs is never really explained , but the fact that they are \" friends \" is questioned only is superficial ways ( greg gets really mad at shane because he \\' s been elevated to bartender status ) . there isn \\' t a single conflict that takes center stage , except that shane has some kind of unexplored reservation with the business in which he works . most of the film is dumb , and most of the dialogue is inane . there \\' s a scene late in the film in which shane confronts julie black , and , in the next scene , they \\' re arm - in - arm without a bit of development . then , they \\' re kissing in a bowling alley ! this is five minutes of material , thrown into the picture at the last minute ( well past the one - hour mark , and this isn \\' t a long film to begin with ) . campbell is a talented actress , but she needs a role that gives her a little depth . this one doesn \\' t . and phillippe has almost no presence whatsoever ; this performance pales in comparison to mark whalberg \\' s star - making role in boogie nights . he seems dumb and misguided , and his voice never changes tone . i guess he was picked for the color of his hair and the shape of his body , but he seems pretty lanky to me . he \\' s all wrong for a lead role , but it doesn \\' t help that christopher has forgotten to develop his characters . by the end of 54 , shane \\' s most notable trait is his stupid , fake accent . the rest of the performances are wasted . hayek is an energetic , talented young actress , and does almost nothing here . meyer is endearing , but allowed to be no deeper than cardboard . only myers , by sheer force of talent , manages to rise above christopher \\' s wading - pool of a script . rubell has been written just as depthless as the rest of the characters , but myers is good enough to inject subtleties that help round out the performance . in fact , myers is the sole reason to see 54 , and all it really does is make you wish that the film had revolved around him . i \\' ve read that studio 54 has been recreated down to the last detail . frankly , i don \\' t care . it \\' s easy to recreate something technical like this . a fairly skilled production designer and a few carpenters can manage such a task . besides , christopher keeps the lights so low that the sets are invisible , anyway . aside from myers \\' performance , 54 is a complete failure . it \\' s dull , perfunctory , uninspired , and boring . some may find my comparisons to boogie nights unfair , but they \\' re so obvious to me . in any event , 54 is pallid without the contrast . it doesn \\' t even work as mindless entertainment : it \\' s so shallow that the most escapist viewers are likely to dismiss it . so , don \\' t forget those key words : dull , perfunctory , uninspired , and boring . everything else i said was just padding .',\n",

              " ('\" dangerous beauty \" is a really nothing more than a grandiose soap opera set in venice circa 1583 . it is beautifully filmed , wonderfully acted , and certainly nothing short of entertaining , but it lacks any true fundamental seriousness . dealing with themes of forbidden love , religious intolerance , subordination of women , sexual freedom , and the roles of pleasure and sin in a high - cultured society , it still feels like brightly lit fluff . the director , marshall herskovitz , doesn \\' t want to follow the dark and dangerous trail this story could lead down , so he opts for a more genial , livelier , and relatively shallow interpretation . the film takes place during the renaissance , a time when venice was the pleasure capital of europe . at this time , venice was its own republic , and it thrived on being the central juncture of east - west commerce . the film is told almost entirely through the viewpoint of the aristocracy and the bourgeoisie of venice , so we rarely get to see how the rest of the society lived . however , there is an abundance of detail concerning the lives and livelihoods of the upper classes , their hedonistic lifestyles and constant merriment . the story centers on veronica franco ( catherine mccormack ) , a lower class woman who falls in love with marco venier ( rufus sewell ) , the son of wealthy aristocratic parents ( jeroen krabb ? and joanna cassidy ) . unfortunately , the culture of that time period did not view marriage as an act of love -- rather , it was more like a business transaction , where rich families married their sons and daughters to each other in order to secure power , wealth , and ensure that outsiders couldn \\' t get in . veronica , despite her charm and good looks , is certainly an outsider . after a short love affair , marco breaks her heart with the news that he cannot marry her . however , because she is beautiful and intelligent , veronica has a chance to enter marco \\' s world , albeit not as his wife . she decides to become a courtesan -- a class of women who were as well - educated as they were ravishing , and sold their sexuality to wealthy men for the privilege of wining and dining with the elite . a courtesan was not a mere prostitute ; they were afforded a special place in society , and they were greatly revered , respected , and often envied . at one point , a character mentions that some rulers obtain more political advice from their courtesans than from their lieutenants . veronica goes through the transformation with the help of her mother , paola ( jacqueline bisset ) , who was once a famed courtesan herself . once she enters the lifestyle , veronica finds that it suits her quite well . she is allowed to read all the books she wants , she is given the opportunity to publish her poetry , and she has the richest and most powerful men in the republic throwing themselves at her feet , including the awestruck marco . their relationship develops into a playful bantering , with veronica utilizing her newfound power by constantly rejecting marco \\' s advances . in many ways , their relationship is sad because marco is married to a women he is unable to love , and veronica is consumed by multiple relationships with men she is unwilling to love . \" love the love , not the man , \" as her mother told her . \" dangerous beauty , \" which was based on a factual book by margaret rosenthal , flows along as smoothly and serenely as the grand canal running through the heart of venice . it has multiple plot lines -- including veronica \\' s adversarial relationship with a court poet ( oliver platt ) , her role in obtaining france \\' s military assistance in venice \\' s battle against the turks , and even the dreaded shadow of the plague and the encroachment of the spanish inquisition -- yet it is never confusing or overbearing . much of the film \\' s success is due to the glowing performance by catherine mccormack in the lead role . known chiefly for the small part she played as the lover whose murder raised mel gibson \\' s ire in \" braveheart \" ( 1995 ) , mccormack shows the true gifts and inarguable talent of a leading lady . she has the kind of exquisite classical beauty that would be treasured in a courtesan ; her character is intelligent , witty , and both sensual and vulnerable , all of which mccormack easily transmits with a single flash of her eyes . the rest of the roles are also filled well , including rufus sewell whose performance here and earlier this month in \" dark city \" have assured him a solid place in hollywood . he has the same kind of unusual good looks and charm of ray liotta , and he seems perfectly at home in period dramas . oliver platt plays a variation of the comic relief role that he has come to inhabit like a second skin , although the film deals his character a cheap blow at the end by having him improbably join the inquisition and turn into the bad guy . platt is a good actor , but he \\' s just too hard to hate . jacqueline bisset proves that she is every bit as stirring as she ever was , and even fred ward turns up in a small , but moving performance as marco \\' s uncle . \" dangerous beauty \" is marshall herskovitz \\' s sophomore directorial effort , after the overlooked 1993 film \" jack the bear . \" partnered with edward zwick , herskovitz has spent most of his time as a producer on television ( \" thirtysomething , \" \" my so - called life \" ) and in the movies ( \" legends of the fall \" ) . his directing style can be best described as transparent -- it never gets in the way of the story , yet it has no discernible flourish or particular distinctions . he could have approached the film in any number of ways , including overdosing on the sexual aspect , which he wisely avoids . \" dangerous beauty \" contains just enough bare flesh and ribald sex to make it appropriately erotic , but not so much that it seems exploitative . herskovitz is also aided by a strong supporting crew , including the luscious photography by bojan bazelli , whose previous efforts include the highly - stylized thriller \" kalifornia \" ( 1993 ) and abel ferrara \\' s dark sci - fi film \" body snatchers \" ( 1994 ) . bazelli captures the film in strong , bold colors , and be brings sixteenth - century venice to life in wide , panoramic shots that are often enhanced with digital imagery . however , the real details are found in the production design by norman garwood ( \" brazil , \" \" the princess bride \" ) and the costumes by gabriella pescucci ( \" the age of innocence \" ) . the only problem with \" dangerous beauty \" is that it doesn \\' t stick with you . it \\' s a good story well - told with interesting characters , but it \\' s easy to shrug off once you \\' ve left the theater . the only sequence that has the chance to be truly indelible is veronica being pulled in front of the hypocrisy of the inquisition and threatened with the death penalty for her transgressions , but it never quite comes off because it \\' s simply too melodramatic and conventional . herskovitz tries with all his might to make it a nailbiter , but somehow its outcome is a foregone conclusion , and like the rest of the film , it carries no real weight , despite the potential severity of the subject matter .',\n",

              " (\"usually when one is debating who the modern queen of the romantic comedy is they will bring up names like julia roberts or sandra bullock . others will mention meg ryan . but for me , it ' s not even close . janeane garofalo is not only the queen of the romantic comedy , she is the best comic actress in hollywood right now . and it ' s a good thing she ' s starring in the matchmaker , because without her presence the movie would be bland , unfunny , and dull . garofalo stars as marcy tizard , a top aide to boston senator john mcglory , who is suffering in the polls . in an attempt to capture the irish vote , he sends marcy on a mission to a small irish town called ballinagra in search of other mcglory ' s that never moved to america . unfortunately for marcy , her visit coincides with the town ' s annual matchmaking festival . things get off to a rocky start for marcy though . she has no hotel reservations ( for no rational reason ) and the tiny confined room ( tired old cliche ' ) she has to stay in has a visitor in her bathtub . his name is sean , and marcy finds him repugnant at first , so you can obviously tell where this is headed . the movie runs into a few roadblocks . for instance , the story is very thin . none of the characters ( except the old local matchmaker ) are nearly as interesting as garofalo . some of the characters , like the political aide played by denis leary , have wandered in from a completely different movie . i think the director realized this and decided to throw in numerous shots of the beautiful irish scenery , and several close - ups of garofalo ' s winning smile . the strange thing is that it works . garofalo ' s charm and the irish scenery could carry the thinnest of stories , and it carries this one .\",\n",

) , but his kidnapped daughter , keiko ( china chow ) , also happens to be paris \\' goddaughter . so , when paris finds out she \\' s been kidnapped , he takes it personally and becomes determined to find out who did it . not knowing the cisco is actually behind the whole scheme , paris puts him in charge of rooting out the kidnapper . of course cisco blames the whole thing on poor , innocent melvin . along the way , there are several obligatory gunfights , explosions , and car chases , plus a literal cliffhanger inspired by \" jurassic park , \" and a completely unconvincing romance between melvin and keiko ( who looks like she \\' s barely pushing fifteen ) . what the movie passes off as humor resorts to thoroughly unfunny jokes about overweight jewish mothers , hara - kiri , drinking problems , leaking body bags , and a running gag about how crunch has recently discovered the pleasures of masturbation , and now spends all his time doing hand exercises . not to mention the pimply video store clerk who is always calling melvin and screeching about how he needs to return his copy of \" king kong lives , \" which is two weeks overdue . this mess of a movie was helmed by che - kirk wong , the latest hong kong director imported by john woo ( \" face / off \" ) , who also served as executive producer . woo needs to stop acting as a conduit for other directors , and start making more of his own films . wong , who directed such films as \" rock \\' n \\' roll cop \" back in hong kong , is completely tone deaf when it comes to comedy . maybe jokes about vexatious video clerks and vomiting on other people are funny across the ocean , but they \\' re not here , at least in the manner wong handles them . many of the problems can be traced back to the script , which was penned by obvious freshman writer ben ramsey . in addition to his vague characterizations and uninspired action sequences , ramsey \\' s script assaults the audience with his attempts to copy the vulgar , poetic rhythms of tarantino or mamet - style dialogue . what he comes out with is just a lot of annoying blather , most of which spews from the lips of lou diamond phillips ( whose favorite phrase is \" it \\' s all love \" ) and robin dunne , who plays cisco \\' s stuttering , black - wannabe assistant . the irritation factor of phillips and dunne combined is almost off the scale , which can pretty much describe the film as a whole .',\n",

              " ('what makes reindeer games even more disappointing than just a predictable , lifeless action flick is the cast and crew who signed onto the project . most of the people involved in reindeer games just came off terrible slumps with excellent comeback performances in their most recent films . john frankenheimer , who made the unforgettable cold war drama the manchurian candidate way back in the early 60 \\' s , recently showed critics and fans alike that he still had some magic left in his directorial skills when he created the brilliant car chase scenes in ronin . screenwriter ehren kruger gave a remarkable first impression when he wrote the script for the underrated arlington rd . ben affleck displayed his comedic talents in dogma and boiler room , and even on saturday night live directly after the horrible forces of nature and 200 cigarettes . even charlize theron , who i was convinced couldn \\' t act , did a decent job in cider house rules . when all of these bright stars come together , one would assume that the movie will have great potential to be entertaining . after coming out of the theater showing reindeer games , disbelief was my first reaction ? then frustration . the movie could have premiered on cinemax at two in the morning starring an all - rookie cast and still would have been equally lacking in entertaining . the acting is so pitiful and the script so dull , i may have to rethink some of my opinions on how talented these actors actually are . it seemed like everyone was restricted to just the script and not given a fair amount of improvisational rights . we have all seen ben affleck have some fun on the set , it is so apparent in a number of scenes in good will hunting when he exchanges jokes with his friends at a bar . the actors in that movie were having fun and , from that , the audience had fun . reindeer games is the complete opposite ; the actors don \\' t seem to want to be their characters ( even danny trejo , who will do practically anything , doesn \\' t look like he is enjoying himself ) , causing the audience to quickly lose interest . evidence of public disapproval was noted when a woman behind me yelled \" boy this movie is horrible ! \" and when there were scattered giggles during the most dramatic moments . the story follows a man , rudy ( ben affleck ) , who is leaving prison in a few days along with his best friend and cellmate nick ( james frain ) . nick has been exchanging love letters with a beautiful woman , ashley ( charlize theron ) , and cannot wait to leave prison and meet her in person . when nick is killed in a prison riot , rudy decides to pretend to be nick and take ashley out on a date for the christmas holidays . unfortunately ashley \\' s brother , gabriel ( gary sinise ) interferes with their relationship . thinking rudy is nick , he kidnaps rudy and threatens to kill him unless he helps rob a casino , which nick use to work at as a security guard . now rudy must pretend to be nick so he can protect ashley from her brother gabriel . confused ? the movie only gets more complex as it goes on , until it gets way , way too complex at its climax . but reindeer games makes its first serious mistake during the first half an hour . the hero commits a greedy , selfish act when he decides to pretend he is his dead cellmate in order to date ashley . some hero . the point of a hero is to do the morally correct thing , a person for the audience to relate to or admire . when rudy lies and cheats his way into trouble , instead of gathering support from me for him to ultimately succeed in getting the bad guys , i felt more like he was getting what he deserved and even wanted to see him fail at times . the most irritating part of the film ( besides the fact that this is a christmas movie released in february ) is the number of chances the bad guys get to kill rudy but fail or delay for some idiotic reason . the routine in which the bad guy must explain his genius plan to the hero before attempting to kill him with some elaborate machine is getting so tired nowadays , especially when i eagerly want to see the hero dead . the only saving grace keeping this movie from receiving zero stars is an amusing but pointless cameo from isaac hayes as a prisoner upset with his food . why he was in this movie for such a pointless role beats me . why any of these people had anything at all to do with this movie beats me .',\n",

              " ('\" psycho meets the exorcist with no holds barred \" . a blurb like that sounds like desperate publicity for some low budget , third rate rip - off . but no , this tacky plug comes from the poster for suspiria , perhaps italian horror director dario argento \\' s most consistently successful film . what impresses most in re - watching this surrealistic , supernatural thriller is that argento \\' s directorial flair and stylish visuals are matched by a near - fully coherent narrative . screenplays have always been his achilles heel ; confusing subplots , gaping holes , totally illogical incidents and reactions . no question : argento has always been a better director than a writer . fortunately , he gets the plotting pretty well right with suspiria , taking his cue from a book by thomas de quincey called \" suspiria de profundis \" . the film \\' s storyline suffers from no major lapses in logic , provided one can accept the premise of a ballet school being a front for a coven of witches . jessica harper plays an american who travels to germany to further her studies in dance . arriving at the school late at night in driving rain , she sees a girl leave and run into the storm in a clearly distressed state . what happens next - and i don \\' t make the comparison lightly - is a murder sequence that for intensity , shock value and sheer directorial flair ranks alongside alfred hitchcock \\' s infamous shower scene in psycho . it \\' s quite possibly a homage to hitchcock , but with its baroque sets , graphic gore and brilliantly chaotic musical accompaniment by the gothic rock group goblin , this stunning sequence remains very much argento \\' s own . though nothing else quite equals the intensity of suspiria \\' s opening 15 minutes , the film continues to be never anything less than engrossing as harper begins her own investigations and slowly comes to realise this is no ordinary ballet school . we meet an assortment of slightly sinister characters , most notably the head ballet teacher played by alida valli in another one of those delicious sour - old - matriarch - from - hell roles she does so well . several more violent murders ensue , including a startling scene in a deserted square where a blind man is . . . well , i wouldn \\' t want to spoil things now , would i ? and the film \\' s climax , staged amid secret corridors and hidden rooms , has a gothic ghoulishness that \\' s most impressive . the english language versions of most argento movies usually suffer trimming , and not just for the violence - deep red and phenomena , for example , have been appallingly hacked about . fortunately , the cuts to suspiria ( about 7 minutes in this version ) have not adversely affected the film . the dubbing of the italian actors into english is quite competently done , too , excepting one appalling and unintentionally hilarious effort with a conversation between harper and a professor about the history of witchcraft in the region . and the soundtrack ? it is interesting to imagine what power the film would have lost if it had been scored by someone else . as it stands , the use of goblin \\' s music in suspiria is outstanding . apparently , argento played the soundtrack on location while filming so the actors could hear the music as they acted out their parts . a stereo video player adds greatly to the viewer \\' s overall experience . even better , see suspiria in a cinema , where you \\' ll get the added bonus of widescreen . and the colours ! deep reds , eerie blues , a superb use of shadow and contrast . the cinematography of luciano tovoli , whose more recent credits include reversal of fortune and single white female , is uniformly superb . a nod also must go to production designer giuseppe bassan for his wonderful baroque interiors . these kinds of settings are crucial to the atmosphere of argento \\' s more surreal excursions , the other most notable example being inferno ( 1980 ) on which bassan also worked . suspiria is the film that broke dario argento into the major league of european directors , and it is fully deserving of its cult status . the gore is at times a little excessive and overstated - that \\' s always been one of argento \\' s shortcomings - but overall this is a fascinating , compelling example of italian horror .',\n",

              " ('alien 3 is the only alien film i have seen in theaters . i saw it when i was 13 years old , and i must admit that i didn \\' t like it . of course , i was expecting aliens again , and i believe this was my fault . in order to appreciate alien 3 , you need to see aliens , but you also have to wipe away all the expectations from its predecessor . james cameron \\' s aliens was an action film , and many people consider it the best in the series . i am among that group , but alien 3 is an extremely entertaining film , which critics have bashed for its originality . many thought the final chase scene went on for too long , and many others thought that the film was too much dialogue and not enough action . both are untrue , because the film has quite a bit of action , and the dialogue was essential and well - written . as for the chase sequence , it was long , but not overly long , creating quite a bit of suspense from confusion . perhaps watching alien 3 on video helped . on the big screen , i was overwhelmed by something i normally didn \\' t see . it was a very dark film , and the language was extremely harsh . i had always figured the alien series to rely on smart dialogue instead of moronic profanities . don \\' t get me wrong -- i \\' m not saying films should eliminate swearing , but when a film substitutes dialogue with these profane remarks , it gets rather distracting . however , since seeing it again , i realize that the swearing is mainly just an aspect of the restrained hatred in the characters . as a result , alien 3 \\' s only flaw ( albeit a major one ) is the underdeveloped characters . we never really care about any of them , and i get the feeling that many scenes were cut in order to shorten the length of the movie . there were only two characters i liked , and of course one was lt . ripley ( sigourney weaver ) , although we have gotten to know her through two other films . the other character was dr . clemens ( charles dance ) , but because we like him , the inevitable occurs . alien 3 begins exactly where aliens left off . the prologue of alien 3 is a pure cinematic achievement by director david fincher , who had only directed music videos before his chance with this alien entry . without using a single line of dialogue ( unless you count computer warnings ) , fincher sets up the entire film . an impressive aspect of this is that fincher only shows a few seconds of film before cutting to a title card . we see lt . ripley and the little girl in their cryogenic compartments . . . ( title ) . . . a shot of an alien egg . . . ( title ) . . . alien legs stretch up into the air . . . ( title ) . . . and so on and so on . during these first ten minutes , i learned everything i had to in order for alien 3 to proceed . it \\' s quite a remarkable opening , and one which will remain in my mind for a long time . because of this face - hugger which has been hatched aboard the vessel from aliens , the hypersleep containers are sent into an escape pod , and sent down to the nearest planet : fiorina fury - 161 , an ore refinery which has been turned into a maximum security prison . however , the face - hugger managed to attach itself to one of the cryo - tubes , and is sent down with the escape pod . unfortunately , during the landing , all but one of the survivors from aliens is killed . ripley is discovered by some of the inmates and taken back to the refinery . of course , you need a carrier for this face - hugger , and it attachs itself to the dog which came with the team of inmates . ripley is revived and asks to see the ship . after seeing a mysterious acid - eaten section , ripley asks to see the dead bodies , and then have them cremated . this cremation scene is one of the most powerful and impressive of all the alien films . featuring a monologue from dillon ( charles s . dutton ) , a prisoner who has found god , the movie cuts back and forth from the ceremony to the dog \\' s demise . it \\' s one of the most memorable moments , as the speech reflects exactly what is going on with the dog . and this is where alien 3 succeeds . fincher normally injects a lot of symbolism into his films , and i can easily see him becoming the next stanley kubrick or alfred hitchcock ( in fact , he is the mixture of both ) . fincher knows exactly what to film and how to film it , and i figure that he will be one of the few directors with complete control over his films . alien 3 is riddled with symbolic speeches and metaphorical images . by doing so , fincher creates some of the best scenes in the entire alien franchise . many people have criticized fincher \\' s filming of the death scene of ripley ( i reveal nothing by saying this ) as looking too fake , but i enjoy and relish in the portrayal . showing ripley fall in slow motion is a nice touch , but by actually not showing her hit the vat of iron , a great deal of symbolism is derived . i feel that it would have spoiled the mood of the entire film if they had actually shown her splash into the molten iron . however , most people seem to want to witness ripley die ( which creates a paradox , as she is the character i didn \\' t want to see die ) . why she is killed is one of the surprises of the film , and i don \\' t plan on spoiling that in this review . > from every alien film comes several memorable moments which seem to stick with you forever . in alien , it was , of course , the moment the alien burst out of kane \\' s stomach . in aliens , it was the showdown between alien and ripley in a machine . alien 3 has several , but most memorable is the terrific shot involving the alien and ripley . ripley is pushed up against a wall , and the alien stands inches away from her . why it doesn \\' t kill her is a shocker , which later leads to a surprise ending . fincher apparently loves to use close - ups of actors \\' faces ( michael douglas and the clown face - off in the game in the same style ) , and by shaving off the actors \\' hair , the only thing we have to look at is their faces . many critics didn \\' t like all the actors being bald , but it makes complete sense when taken in context of the plot . most of alien 3 works when you take it in context of the story , but when you try to compare it to its predecessors , fincher \\' s turn seems a bit gloomy and dark , though that \\' s not always a bad thing . the plot is pretty much a rehash of the first two films , with some major twists . again , we are setup with several different characters , and one by one , they are picked off . however , while the first two had tons of arsenal ( especially cameron \\' s film ) , alien 3 takes place on a planet devoid of human life except for this run - down prison . as a result , no weapons are to be found . this creates a lot of tension , although i must admit that fincher could have added a lot more suspense . as an alien film , alien 3 is the worst of the series , but by itself , it is an extremely well - made motion picture , with a lot more merits than not . the unfortunate thing surrounding this second sequel is the one - dimensional characters . i never was really emotionally involved on screen because most of the characters are hardcore criminals whom i really could care less about . despite this , ripley was the central figure , and that \\' s what is important . we care for her , even though she began to act just like one of the guys . again , the technical side of this film is remarkable , and better than the two previous versions . while cameron \\' s version was a pumped up action film with massive artillary , fincher uses brilliant camera angles , terrific lighting , and moody sets . the cinematography , by alex thomson , is very well done , with a terrific chase sequence towards the end of the movie . the confusion of the ending draws the viewer in , as we are just as confused as the actors who are being chased around . the yellows , reds , and oranges of the lights create a dark mood , and by themselves create a lot of suspense . shadows dance on the walls , and yet those shadows could easily be the alien . the alien is different from its predecessors this time around , and the swiftness of this alien is quite intense . the camera likes to take up the perspective of the alien , racing after the characters . the sets are quite incredible , which are reminiscient of the nostromo from alien . the narrow corridors and labrynthine hallways is well constructed . the sets appear to be in the future , but not too far in the future . one of the set pieces even aids in the destruction of the alien ( nothing surprising there ) . sigourney weaver turns out yet another good performance , equaling her portrayal of ripley in aliens . she was snubbed at the oscars for this one , mainly because the film was a critical bomb . her reactions are far more realistic in this film , with her crying over the loss of the little child she risked her life saving in her previous encounter . it \\' s quite touching really . charles s . dutton is very strong in his performance as one of the inmates , and i was on the brink of actually caring for him . charles dance turns in a nice low - key performance , and as a result , i cared for him immediately . lance henriksen makes a brief appearance as bishop ii , but he was more entertaining in aliens . the rest of the cast is pretty stale , though pete postlethwaite sticks out due to his recent turns in the usual suspects and the lost world . alien 3 is rated r for strong violence and language , and sex . although it has its flaws , alien 3 is highly entertaining with rich symbolism . this film reminds you how much fun it is to spot metaphorical images throughout a movie . while kubrick may have a moral message throughout his films , fincher relies on cinematic devices to bring his meanings out . it \\' s a film like fincher \\' s which reminds us that it is okay for a film to sacrifice quality for quantity ( the final scene ) . in fact , it tells us that we , as a society , have become too critical of things which may happen to look a little \" fake . \" whenever something looks fake on screen , we immediately point it out as a mistake . but perhaps it isn \\' t a mistake .',\n",

              " ('\" a bug \\' s life \" may not be \" toy story , \" but it \\' s more close than \" antz \" was . i really liked \" antz , \" basically because , yes , it is clever and witty and intelligent ( and it has the temerity to take a chance and put woody allen in the lead , perhaps the year \\' s most inspired casting ) , but there was , in fact , something missing from it , and i \\' m the first to admit that . maybe it \\' s that it never totally lets go and takes off into real innocent fun - it \\' s too obsessed with its orwellian message to become totally engaging , and if it weren \\' t for woody allen , it would have been just a really clever good - not - great flick . \" a bug \\' s life \" has a similar premise , and it also has disney to insure that it \\' s g - rated and not totally over kids \\' heads like \" antz \" was ( not a bad thing , believe me ) , but what it also has is a tone that \\' s completely innocent even when it \\' s also remaining perpetually clever . \" antz \" is still the more witty film , and i love it for it , and \" a bug \\' s life \" is more for general consumption , but it \\' s also more entertaining . it broadens its horizons , and when it really moves from the ant colony , it really shows us a whole new world we \\' ve never seen before , and it \\' s take on the evolution of bugs is a lot better than the one in \" antz . \" it \\' s also light and clever . the visuals are , instead of earth tones , bright worldly colors , and still gives the amazing visual technology of \" antz \" at least a worthy contender . the characters are also nicely realized - though watered - down for broad consumption , they still carry more wit than the contemporary disney animated films . the lead character , flik ( voiced by dave foley ) , is nothing more than a slightly - less neurotic z from \" antz , \" but foley makes him nearly as engaging as allen made z . instead of gene hackman playing the villain , we get the much more menacing kevin spacey as the lead grasshopper , the nicely - titled hopper . and for the romantic lead , we don \\' t get spacey sharon stone , but intelligent and hard - to - get julia - louis dreyfuss , who doesn \\' t even come around until the very final frames . not that the plot \\' s really any better than the one in \" antz \" - it \\' s basically yet another redux of \" the seven samurai , \" with an ant colony under the control of giant grasshoppers forcing them to produce a product for them or else . when flik , a bone fide inventor , creates a time - conserving apparatus that accidentally destroys the season \\' s donation , he puts them all in risk , and is sent away so that he won \\' t screw anything up with the pretense that he is searching for help to fight the grasshoppers . he runs into a group of \" warrirors \" who are , unbeknownst to him , a group of carnival bugs , and they agree to help under similar false pretenses . these bugs are an equally wonderful assortment to anything in \" toy story \" : foppish walking stick slim ( david hyde - pierce ) , german caterpillar heimlich ( joe ranft ) , quick - tempered and insecure male ladybug francis ( denis leary ) , pretentious praying mantis manny ( jonathan harris ) , his assistant butterfly hypsy ( madeliene kahn ) , spider rosie ( bonnie hunt ) , and two fleas , tuck and roll ( michael mcshane ) , who speak in undiscernable jibberish . the writers lightly touch on each bug \\' s place in bug society and the malleability thereof while making a wisecracks at everything they can , and blowing the audience away with wild visual treats . grasshoppers jumping in unison seems like a menacing earthquake . a small bird becomes an ominous mortal threat , whose usual mild - mannered squeal is a scream of death . the bug city is a modern - day metropolis , complete with fireflies temping as traffic lights and a fly sitting on the curb , holding out a cup , with a sign lying next to him that says \" kid tore off wings . \" and a rainstorm is like a giant flood , with each drop acting like a small bomb dropped at millions of miles per hour . around this , the pixar animators stage several large set pieces , like a resuce mission halfway through that is as wild and entertaining as anything this year , and a wonderfully exciting action piece at the end , a chase scene at night through the labyrinthine branches of a small thicket . meanwhile , each character gets the spotlight to be completely idisyncratic and interesting , something \" antz \" couldn \\' t do , and by the end , over the end credits , \" a bug \\' s life \" pulls it \\' s final punch , out clever -

              " (\"the keen wisdom of an elderly bank robber , the naive ambitions of a sexy hospital nurse , and a partnership that blossoms between the two are the fine components that make up a modest , little caper adventure entitled ` where the money is . ' the elderly bank robber is henry ( paul newman ) , a famous criminal that was only recently caught . he has pulled off dozens of successful heists and has probably stashed away a small fortune . always the shrewd thinker , he begins working on a plan to get out of jail . this involves years of studying buddhism and self - hypnosis . when he is prepared to execute his plan , he uses what he has learned to fake a stroke . now a seemingly twitching vegetable , he is temporarily transferred to a state - run home . carol ( linda fiorentino ) is the nurse that cares for him . she ' s a very bright person with a good heart . yet , her life is a miserable waste of time . the most exciting thing to do in town is to fix cars . her days at the hospital facility are spent leading wheelchair calisthenics . worse , she ' s in a dead - end relationship with high - school sweetheart wayne ( dylan mcdermott ) . they became a couple because they were king and queen of the prom . to her , this made sense long ago . but now , it ' s a different story . wayne seems equally bored with his life , but is content enough to stay put . wayne ' s greatest ambition is to become a night shift supervising foreman . carol feels as lifeless as many of the other hospital patients , but she ' s never been anywhere else and doesn ' t see many other opportunities in life . however , when henry falls under her care , her outlook begins to change . the medical reports may state that he suffered a massive stroke . carol , however , begins to grow suspicious that henry may just be faking it after all . maybe she can get through to him , and maybe she can learn something about the money that he has stashed away . the opening 30 minutes are filled with hilarious attempts of carol trying to bring henry ? back to life . ' and what are some of carol ' s resuscitation techniques ? perhaps an erotic lapdance might stir his senses . if that fails , maybe she ' ll try a little shock therapy by pushing him off a 20 - foot high pier into the cold lake below . when he finally comes out of his state of self - trance , the movie ' s direction changes , though it remains equally if not more entertaining . carol sees that henry is filled with charisma and self - assuredness . she is invigorated by his commanding presence and refreshed by his vibrancy . this , of course , puts wayne in an odd situation . henry and carol ' s bond grows stronger when they enter into an agreement to rob an armored car . henry needs this heist because he is unable to retrieve his original stash . meanwhile , this is carol ' s ticket to a better life . wayne is uncomfortable with the situation , but helps out nonetheless . however , his lack of commitment threatens their success . the heist sequence is suspenseful , well paced , and casts the uneasy feeling that something will horribly go wrong . ` where the money is ' does more to spotlight newman and fiorentino than it does to showcase a story about a nifty heist . newman is the real joy of the film , adroitly showing that at age 75 , he ' s still really hot stuff . he possesses a sly smile , displays a dominating attitude , and a projects a demeanor that is undeniably attractive . fiorentino is also a fun presence . you root for her despite her sense of amorality . sure , she wants to commit robbery and has little compunction about pushing a wheelchair - stricken man into a lake , but we can see that to escape her dead - end world , she needs to do something drastic . with two charismatic characters such as these , it ' s hard to ignore that ` where the money is ' is where the fun is .\",\n",

dum . from there , director steven spielberg wastes no time , taking us into the water on a midnight swim with a beautiful girl that turns deadly . right away he lets us know how vulnerable we all are floating in the ocean , and once \" jaws \" has attacked , it never relinquishes its grip . perhaps what is most outstanding about \" jaws \" is how spielberg builds the movie . he works it like a theatrical production , with a first act and a second act . unlike so many modern filmmakers , he has a great deal of restraint , and refuses to show us the shark until the middle of the second act . until then , he merely suggests its presence with creepy , subjective underwater shots and williams \\' music . he \\' s building the tension bit by bit , so when it comes time for the climax , the shark \\' s arrival is truly terrifying . he doesn \\' t let us get bored with the imagery . the first act opens with police chief martin brody ( roy scheider ) , a new york cop who has taken an easy , peaceful job running the police station on amity island , a fictitious new england resort town where there hasn \\' t been a murder or a gun fired in 25 years . the island is shaken up by several vicious great white shark attacks right before the fourth of july , and the mayor , larry vaughn ( murray hamilton ) , doesn \\' t want to shut down the beaches because the island is reliant on summer tourist money . brody is joined by matt hooper ( richard dreyfuss ) , a young , ambitious shark expert from the marine institute . hooper is as fascinated by the shark as he is determined to help brody stop it -- his knowledge about the exact workings of the shark ( \" it \\' s a perfect engine , an eating machine \" ) make it that much more terrifying . when vaughn finally relents , hooper and brody join a crusty old shark killer named quint ( robert shaw ) on his decrepit boat , the orca , to search for the shark . the entire second act takes place on the orca as the three men hunt the shark , and inevitably , are hunted by it . \" jaws \" is a thriller with a keen sense of humor and an incredible sense of pacing , tension , and horror . it is like ten movies all rolled into one , and it \\' s no wonder it took america by storm in the summer of 1975 , taking in enough money to crown it the box office champ of all time ( until it was unceremoniously dethroned in 1977 by \" star wars \" ) . even today , fascination with this film is on par with hitchcock \\' s \" psycho , \" and it never seems to age . although grand new technology exists that makes the technical sequences , including several mechanical sharks , obsolete , none of it could improve the film because it only would lead to overkill . the technical limitations faced by spielberg in 1975 may have actually produced a better film because it forced him to rely on traditional cinematic elements like pacing , characterization , sharp editing , and creative photography , instead of simply dousing the audience with digital shark effects . scheider , dreyfuss , and shaw were known actors at the time \" jaws \" was made , but none of them had the draw of a robert redford or paul newman . nevertheless , this film guaranteed them all successful careers because each gave an outstanding performance and refused to be overshadowed by the shark . scheider hits just the right notes as a sympathetic husband and father caught in the political quagmire of doing what \\' s right and going against the entire town . \" it \\' s your first summer here , you know , \" mayor vaughn warns him . dreyfuss , who had previously been seen in \" american graffiti \" ( 1973 ) and \" the apprenticeship of duddy kravitz \" ( 1974 ) gives a surprisingly mature , complex performance for someone who had literally only played kids and teenagers . however , most outstanding is the gnarled performance by robert shaw as the movie \\' s captain ahab , a performance sorely overlooked by the academy awards . bordering of parody , shaw plays quint as a grizzled old loner whose machismo borders on masochism . he \\' s slightly deranged , and shaw \\' s performance is almost a caricature . however , there is one scene late in the film , when he and brody and hooper are below deck on the orca comparing scars . quint is drawn into telling the story of his experiences aboard the u . s . s . indianapolis , a navy ship in world war ii that was sunk by the japanese . his tale of floating in the water for more than a week with over 1 , 000 other men while swarms of sharks slowly devoured them them is actually more hair - raising than anything spielberg put on screen . shaw delivers the story in one long take , and it is the best acting in the film . of course , we can \\' t leave out the shark itself ; with its black eyes , endless rows of teeth , and insatiable urge to eat , it is basically the epitome of all mankind \\' s fears about what is unknown and threatening in nature . a shark is such a perfect nemesis it is real -- having survived sinch the dinosaurs , great whites do exist , they can be as large as the shark in \" jaws , \" and they are a threat . every one of spielberg \\' s subjective underwater shots makes us feel queasy because lets us see how we look to the shark : a bunch of writihing , dangling , completely unprotected legs just ready to be chomped into . the shark in \" jaws \" was actually a combination of actual footage and five different mechanical sharks ( all nicknamed \" bruce \" by the crew ) built to be shot from different angles . many have forgotten , but \" jaws \" was a sort of precursor to \" waterworld \" ( 1995 ) , a movie \\' s who soggy production and cost overruns had universal studios worried about a bomb . but , as we can see now , spielberg overcame all the obstacles , and delivered one of the finest primal scare - thrillers ever to come out of hollywood .',\n",

              " ('seen july 8 , 1998 at the crossgates cinema 18 , ( albany , ny ) , theater # 7 , at 8 : 15 p . m . with my mom using hoyts cinema cash . [ theater rating : * * * 1 / 2 : very good sound , picture , and seats ] it \\' s very rare that any medium of entertainment can give one an authentic , vivid sense of reality and life . all stories are about select moments of time and places in the characters \\' lives , but only the truly great ones are able to define their realities well enough so the audience can experience it just as the characters do . therefore , \" gone with the wind \" deserves accolades for its ability to tell the epic story it does , in such a crafted , intricate , and entertaining manner . it \\' s a crowning achievement , not only in filmmaking , but for storytelling itself . the film takes place in georgia before , during , and after the civil war . this plays a major factor in the film \\' s success . to use such a historic setting presents many possibilities and problems since no one was alive at the time to verify its accuracy . it might also seem cliche , boring and other such deterent factors to potential viewers . can a story set so long ago be relatable now ? the film confronts all these problems , paradoxically , by not cronfronting them . it doesn \\' t simply plug in the \" right thing \" at the \" right time , \" it creates an entire reality where everything makes sense and said concerns are irrelevant . building a strong foundation is important to all forms of media , without which , what is there to build on ? we \\' re given some backstory here and learn a little about our characters , especially our main character , scarlett o \\' hara ( leigh ) , a beautiful southern belle with a will of steel , a cunning wit , and a tremendous sense of liberty in such an oppressive time . she knows how her society works , wherein everything she does can and will play a role in the shaping of her life and those around her . right from the beginning we realize how determined she is to have her way no matter what the consequences may be . being the most sought - after woman allows her to manipulate men ( and their women ) to ensure she gets her way , whether it be obvious ( i . e . who will be the one to get her food ) , or subtle ( i . e . getting married just to spite someone ) . the man she claims to love is ashley wilkes ( howard ) , a modest gentleman who does not seem to have the same passion for her as she does for him . he isn \\' t so arrogant and demanding as scarlett , in fact , he \\' s engaged to a woman with a personality much more like his . her name is melanie ( de havilland ) , and she is one of the sweetest , kindest , and most likable characters one will ever see . she and scarlett become very dear friends , but she never suspects the jealously scarlett has for her , and the love she has for her husband . her meekness is both her strongest and weakest characteristic - it defines who she is , but doesn \\' t give her much emotional self - defense . acting a catalyst to the love triangle , and to the story as a whole is the daper , stong - willed , cunning , cocky southern business and military man captain rhett butler ( gable ) . he \\' s quite a character all right - everyone listens to what he has to say even though he \\' s got a bad reputation . butler makes no apologies for his vast amount of money nor his behavior . he tells everyone the much - needed truth in the rigid caste - like society where freewill doesn \\' t seem to exist , everything is done out of honor and tradition . for example , in his first appearance butler tells his fellow southerners there \\' s no way the south could defeat the north if war were to break out . this angers them , not for his lack of faith , but because he has the gall to say it aloud and boastfully at that . \" do we have ammunition factories ? do we have food ? do we have a navy ? all we have is tobacco . \" all true statements and yet the south still insists he \\' s wrong . butler is a shifty character to be sure , but he takes such pride in his arrogance it \\' s appealing . scarlett notices this too when she first sees him , and from the look butler gives her , we know he \\' s not going to stop until he has her . but scarlett can \\' t get past her need for ashley , and during a scene which sets the stage for the grand story , butler learns of this and continues to throw it back at scarlett forever . and so the story goes on , with scarlett being thrown obstacle after obstacle in her life . the conflicts she must overcome range from taking care of her entire family to finding a proper husband , especially after she is \" marked \" for life when her first husband dies . this gives the film many opportunities to bring in more characters into the epic story . some are vital for only a few scenes , but their true signifcance will endure throughout the film . in most films only a few characters exist for support in background , but this film is more realistic and believable as it incorporates a supporting cast the size of a small town and everyone has signficance . even people in the background seem more than just extras wandering the set . the costuming design is outstanding so that the film makes for a real sense of time and place . the filmmakers could have easily set more scenes indoors and narrowly focused to avoid having to show the outside , real world , but these types of simple approaches are never taken . the first half of the film depicts the traumatic experience the south faced at the last days of the civil war . fleming is able to convey the horror of it all by painting an image of destruction and letting the viewer decide just how bad it is . one scene has scarlett working as a nurse at a military hospital while we hear a soldier in the background screaming , \" no ! not my leg ! don \\' t cut off my leg ! \" another scene shows her simplying trying to cross a street , but as the camera pulls back , we see that her path is blocked by hundreds of wounded soldiers , but it is their moaning that \\' s more graphic than all the bloody gore could ever be . as the second half begins , the film concentrates more on scarlett as a completely independent woman who single - handedly takes care of her family and melanie just to spite the tyrany of the north . she manages to resurrect the family plantation , but all the willpower she has can \\' t help her when she must pay exuberhant taxes set by the north after the south \\' s ultimate defeat . this brings rhett butler back into the picture and thus begins their torrid love - hate relationship . most of the second half of the film is somehow related to the relationship ( or lack thereof ) between rhett and scarlett . each uses the other for personal gain , but at the same time they still feel an intimate connection with each other . scarlett continues to use her manipulative powers over men to get what she wants and because rhett can \\' t help but want her more every time she tries to one - up him such as marrying another man and taking over his business . they say opposites attract , but the conflict between rhett and scarlett goes way beyond opposing personalities , it borders on magnetic polarization . they need each other and know this , yet they never seem truly happy together . perhaps they mistake love for passion , and the film leaves it up to us to make this call . both have things the other wants and vice versa , but when they compromise , is it just to get their own way or because they actually care for each other . love and the perception of love are two completely separate things and throughout the final act of the film , we \\' re left wondering if rhett and scarlett ever truly loved each other and why . gable and leigh do have great chemistry , always leaving the viewer wondering which emotions were authentic and which were manufacture . all ? none ? either way is possible and it \\' s a mystery that cannot be solved even upon repeated viewings . it \\' s safe to say most of us won \\' t live such overly dramatic lives as those in \" gone with the wind , \" but it \\' s still a masterpiece for its ability to give us a sense that we \\' ve just experienced a life \\' s worth of joy and pain .',\n",

no , but i expected something . a funny joke . a clever prank . a plot development . anything . the movie never delivers . you \\' ve got to marvel at how the filmmakers managed to come up with a movie that is truly about nothing . \" detroit rock city \" is one of those films that you walk out of after the credits have rolled and realize that you just spent 90 minutes watching a movie in which absolutely nothing happened to justify the film \\' s existence , and it \\' s not a very satisfying realization . the film is about four teenage boys , all huge kiss fans from cleveland , trying to get into a kiss concert in detroit , michigan . that \\' s it . there is no big plot description in this review , because the movie has very little plot . the characters are hawk ( edward furlong ) , lex ( giuseppe andrews ) , trip ( james debello ) , and jam ( sam huntington ) . they have a garage band . they \\' re pathetic , like all garage bands , but they like kiss and they like rock n \\' roll , so i guess that means we root for them . they have tickets , they lose them . they get more tickets , they lose those too . they come up with crazy schemes to get tickets , most of which backfire . there \\' s not much more to it . frankly , it becomes a little less than exciting to see them try to get kiss tickets about halfway through the film , when a total of eight tickets have already graced the boys \\' hands , only to be lost because of their sheer stupidity . oh , and jam ( real name jeremiah ) has a really , really annoying ultra - religious mother who ought to be reported to the child welfare agency . she doesn \\' t want them to see kiss , if you hadn \\' t figured that out already . it \\' s really quite disheartening to see such a fine soundtrack go to waste in a pointless movie like this . we \\' ve got plenty of kiss , along with some ac / dc , ramones , and thin lizzy . then again , \" maximum overdrive \" had an awesome soundtrack ( me being the big ac / dc fan that i am ) , but is probably one of the worst movies of all time . \" detroit rock city \" doesn \\' t quite reach that level of ineptitude , but it gets dangerously close . in fact , the music is the only thing that keeps this movie from being a complete failure in my mind . basically , the soundtrack has earned the film a full half - star , which means all the bands involved can pat themselves on the back ( except for marilyn manson , whose half - hearted cover of ac / dc \\' s \" highway to hell \" sounds like something my neighbor \\' s cat coughed up ) . it \\' s also really sad to see the talents of the cast go to waste , because it \\' s evident that they \\' re all trying really hard to squeeze some life out of this dead turkey of a movie . edward furlong has done far better work than this , and so has natasha lyonne , and so has lin shaye , but hey , they \\' ve got to make a living in hollywood . people wanting to see kiss , and lots of it will probably be disappointed , considering the band appears for about five minutes and plays one song . too bad , they might have provided some energy to this mess . director adam rifkin knows he hasn \\' t got much material to work with , so he takes a chapter from the michael bay book of directing and keeps his camera spinning . we get an endless parade of quick - cuts , split - screens , zoom - outs , zoom - ins , and rotating cameras , all in an effort to cover up the sheer stupidity of the script . it \\' s fun for a while , but eventually it becomes disorienting . i would recommend that those who felt seasick at \" the blair witch project \" stay far away from \" detroit rock city , \" because the witch has got nothing on this baby . i haven \\' t felt such an urge to reach out and hold the camera still since \" armageddon . \" and what about that script ?

              " ('in the past , tim burton has taken cinema by storm with the action packed batman , and the hilarious ed wood , but lately his films just don \\' t cut it . sleepy hollow has some unique features , but the script is a terrible mess . for those who remember disney \\' s fantastic \" adventures of ichabod crane \" , it is actually superior to this . disney \\' s version was at least interesting , while burton \\' s film drags on far too long , without any suspense or frights . while the stories are similar , the new version adds too much to the once likable story , and throws in some weak dialogue to top it off . ichabod crane ( johnny depp ) is now apparently a constable , who was sent to new york to investigate suspicious murders . the victims are headless , and no traces of evidence were found , until the murderer reveals himself , hence the headless horseman . now with the help of christina ricci and an orphaned boy , they must stop the headless horseman from a killing spree , that could destroy the whole town of sleepy hollow . sure the headless horseman is an intriguing character , but the story has so many holes that even he nor depp can save this disaster . in the original , the headless horseman was meant to be unstoppable . no one could stop him , not even ichabod . by the end of the film , it had audiences in deep thought . burton however concentrates far too much on the atmosphere , and how to make the main characters heroes . he takes no risk what so ever , and this is where he fails . another pathetic element of the film was the script . like i said earlier , he just stuffed too much in at one time , and made it look real sloppy , kind of like the mess the headless horseman made with his victims . he completely butchered the story to pieces . thankfully there are a few factors that i particularly liked . the acting by depp was quite notable . he took the nerdy character of the cartoon , and simply acted it out in a better manner . if it wasn \\' t for his quirky one - liners , i doubt i could have remained awake , because quite frankly i was getting sleepy . just when i thought christina ricci was getting to be a good actress , she winds up doing this . it just goes to show no actress or actor can pass up a big blockbuster . it \\' s too tempting to let go , even if the script is mush . the atmosphere too was quite involving . i should have just gazed at the sets , and the eerie fog , rather than actually pay attention to what was going on . at least burton \\' s films are eye candy , even if they are trash . the only real scenes of value were the tree full of heads , and the fight between the horseman , depp and casper van dien . other than that , i wish i could just fast forward through all the gaping holes in the film , and just sit back and stare at the scenery . by the end , i can only think back and laugh at how bad sleepy hollow developed . this is the biggest disappointment of the year , especially when such a talented director like burton handles a project like this . don \\' t waste your time or money , because your head will feel hollow .',\n",

              " ('seen february 15 , 1998 on home video ( borrowed from chris wessell ) . when it comes to modern gangster movies , it \\' s really difficult to describe and review them without making comparisons to other films of the genre and / or just using the word \" routine . \" i \\' ve always subscribed to the philosophy that any idea ( no matter how many times it \\' s been used before ) can provide for a good story and \" donnie brasco \" clinches this idea . it \\' s not unlike most of the great films of the genre , yet it never apes another \\' s style as it has a good layer of authenticity , even if its core is a tad stale . the film starts off in typical fashion by defining its atmosphere of new york city in the late 1970s and the mobsters who inhibit it . we meet lefty ( pacino ) , an aging wiseguy who can still walk the walk and talk the talk . he and his associates go through the generic motions you expect to see in crime films like this . somehow he comes across donnie brasco ( depp ) , a younger guy with a lot of spunk who isn \\' t afraid of lefty and his rep , and even manages to befriend him after lefty was ready to kill him . it \\' s clear donnie is new to the life and lefty recognizes this immediately , telling him all the tricks of the trade . i have never seen this technique of actually revealing the mafioso idiosyncrasies done before and for this the film deserves credit . however , we soon realize donnie is actually joe pistone , an fbi agent working undercover - a character who symbolizes the viewer as he will soon be purged into the lifestyle and treated as a newcomer . the first act works as a guided to ot of rhetoric about wiseguy honor , a brief history of the mob , definitions of their slang , and where their money comes from and who it goes to . the screenplay is rather sketchy on the details surrounding these elements , however , the fact they are mentioned at all is quite original . most gangster movies seem to be made with the notion the viewer already knows how the mob works ( probably from watching other gangster movies ) , and although this attitude comes across , the film tries to fill in all the holes where and when it can and the effort is appreciable . thankfully the film doesn \\' t become too caught up in the tedious details of organized crime , and instead opts for character development . much of the story is told simply through the interaction between lefty and donnie . pacino is outstanding here as the pathetic hood who speaks of his job in the same manner any blue collar worker would . he \\' s old and exhausted but seems to enjoy what he does , just as anyone loyal to the same employer for over 30 years might be . we learn of his accomplishments , which are quite impressive within their context , and when he complains about not being made top boss , it \\' s easy to sympathize with him . newell constantly plays up this aspect , making it a major theme which works well in the long run . as donnie is constantly impressing and even one - upping lefty , it \\' s hard to tell which emotion is more powerful : the fact donnie is getting closer to nailing the mob ; or the fact lefty has once again been over shadowed . most of the film tells the story of donnie \\' s life in mafia , which creates for many sub - plots and individual conflicts , but doesn \\' t always seem to come together as a whole . the storytelling is genuinely interesting throughout , even when the motions the characters go through seem familiar . the resonance to donnie \\' s actual assignment varies , he often reports back to the feds with detail of his progress , but it doesn \\' t always seem to have much meaning . back home , his wife maggie ( heche ) is ready to divorce him because he \\' s never a and the family is suffering . since this is based on a true story i wouldn \\' t doubt this would happen , although the way it is handled often borders on the melodramatic . my only major complaint is the film seems to have no final act , or at least any real sense of closure . a climax of sorts does occur , but there \\' s little feeling of a payoff . we get a happy ending , which is good , but perhaps a sad ending would have been more powerful . aside from a few minor , general flaws , \" donnie brasco \" manages to be a solid piece of storytelling and character development . it may be routine , but it \\' s good , and that \\' s respectful .',\n",

              " (\"after a stylistic detour with mrs . parker and the vicious circle ( which , despite its uncomfortable tone , was close to being a conventional movie ) , director alan rudolph has returned to his unique brand of film making with afterglow , a romantic black comedy about love , betrayal , and self - absorption . while these may not be the most unusual themes to fashion into a motion picture , rudolph ' s atypical approach to the characters and their situations makes for an intriguing , if not always pleasant , movie . it is said that rudolph is a polarizing director ? meaning that most viewers either love his work or hate it . until mrs . parker , i had not been overly impressed by his movies . i found equinox , his last pre - mrs . parker effort , to be irritating and frustrating . i was somewhat surprised , therefore , to discover that i liked afterglow . there are several reasons for this , but the paramount one is that rudolph seems to have muted some of the most strident , mannered aspects of his approach . the characters here are more like real people with genuine problems , the story is absorbing , and the acting is top - notch . in short , rudolph has created a world that it ' s worth spending two hours in . afterglow introduces us to two unhappily married couples . jeffrey byron ( jonny lee miller ) is a cold , seemingly - heartless businessman who is sexually indifferent to his young wife , marianne ( lara flynn boyle ) . for her part , marianne is so obsessed with having a baby that she never attempts to interact with her husband on a human level . all she ' s interested in is seducing him during those few days when she ' s ovulating . after he refuses to make love , she decides to find someone else to play the role of sperm donor . the other couple , lucky ( nick nolte ) and phyllis mann ( julie christie ) , are an older pair , but they ' re no more content than jeffrey and marianne . a mysterious fracture in their past relationship has driven them apart . they remain married as a matter of convenience , but , since phyllis won ' t allow lucky to touch her , they have an unspoken agreement whereby he can fool around as much as he wants provided that no lasting bond is established as a result of these affairs . the landscape of emotional pain between them is palpable . the four characters begin interacting when marianne hires lucky as a handyman to fix up the inside of the apartment she shares with jeffrey . the two of them are immediately attracted to one another , and it doesn ' t take long before they ' re lounging together , naked , in her pool . meanwhile , jeffrey , who is captivated by older women , runs into phyllis in a hotel bar , is smitten , and invites her to accompany him on a weekend retreat to the mountains . the romantic couplings of the characters are interesting in that they illustrate the multiple faces of love . sex means something different to everyone ? to jeffrey , it ' s an unpleasant chore , a loss of control ; to marianne , it ' s a means to a maternal end ; to lucky , it ' s an enjoyable distraction that blocks out his marital troubles ; and to phyllis , it ' s a method of establishing or denying emotional closeness . ultimately , none of these characters appears to love anyone else as much as they love themselves . the greatest strength of the film lies not in the script , but in the performances . jonny lee miller is perfect as the selfish , callous , suit - and - tie businessman . those who recall him as sickboy in trainspotting will find that he is almost unrecognizable here as the image of conformity . lara flynn boyle , who wasn ' t impressive in rudolph ' s equinox , is greatly improved , making marianne a jumble of sexiness and vulnerability . nick nolte is delightful as the uninhibited lucky , and he manages to deliver some of rudolph ' s most pregnant lines with practiced ease . the clear standout , however , is julie christie , who is nothing short of delicious as the world - weary phyllis . her often wry , occasionally cutting asides are the source of much of the film ' s humor , and there ' s hardly ever a moment when she doesn ' t steal the spotlight from her co - stars . i don ' t know if afterglow is the film to convert rudolph - detractors , but it seems that this movie is a little more accessible than some of the director ' s earlier productions . enough of his trademark style remains , however , to reassure his supporters . afterglow is basically a four - pronged character study . the plot is not especially compelling , but the character interaction is , and that ' s the real reason to see this motion picture . rudolph has painted an able picture of the non - romantic side of love -- the one that has more to do with tolerance and familiarity than with affection and attraction .\",\n",

, the camera pans out over an urban sunset to the strains of uplifting , inspirational music , then cuts to a studio to reveal that the singing is coming from a group of musicians whom motss has assembled to perform \" we have the right to fight for democracy . \" another scene shows us how , with modern editing equipment , an actress running across a sound stage with a bag of potato chips can be turned into a frightened young girl and her kitten fleeing a terrorist attack on her village . the most consistently effective gag revolves around the propaganda team \\' s attempt to forge a fictional war hero out of sgt . william \" old shoe \" schumann ( woody harrelson ) , an ex - military officer who turns out to be a first - class psycho . of course , not everything goes as planned ; the cia , for example , realizes what \\' s going on and strikes a deal with the president \\' s electoral opponent to report to the media that the \" fighting \" has ended , forcing motss and brean to come up with a new angle on the supposed albanian crisis . still , even with the cia \\' s involvement , the film falls a little short in terms of making this scenario believable . regardless of the official word from the president or the cia , wouldn \\' t the major media outlets have eastern european correspondents who could verify that there is , in fact , no fighting going on in albania ? the film never addresses this question , nor does it show the reactions of the american public to the news of the apparent war except for a few scenes which border on the farcical , such as when basketball fans litter the court with shoes in support of the aforementioned sgt . schumann ; we are apparently meant to assume that everyone is buying it . there was also an instance , towards the end of the film , in which one of motss \\' s forced reinventions of the story seems to contradict what he and brean had been selling to the public thus far and could conceivably have given the game away . with these plot holes , \" wag the dog \" doesn \\' t quite work as a satire of american politics , but it does send up the mentality that might lead to these kinds of machinations in the first place . brean and his advisors never seem concerned that what they are doing is unethical ; rather , they worry about how convincing it will be and whether or not they have enough money to pull it off . the film takes a decidely dark turn towards the end , as we learn how far they are willing to go in order to keep the propaganda campaign a secret . motss and his hollywood buddies , meanwhile , seem completely out of touch with the rest of the world and just see this undertaking as another creative project . in fact , one of the sources of conflict in the film is motss \\' s increasing restlessness with the idea of not being able to take credit for producing the fake war ; in his mind , it is the greatest work of art he has ever created . i think it \\' s fair to say that \" wag the dog \" underachieves a little bit : more attention to the public reaction and tighter plotting might have made this into a four - star film and a classic satire . still , the issue of an american president using war and patriotism to distract from scandals or domestic unpopularity is a very real one . wag the dog takes the issue one step further and asks , what if the war wasn \\' t even real ? with this premise and the talented cast , the film still delivers more consistently than most , whatever its flaws .',\n",

              " ('what surprises me most about the long - awaited batman is that the movie centers not on the caped crusader but on the joker . the dark knight actually has less screen time than his homicidal arch nemesis ! i can hear batfans everywhere protesting : \" first they had the nerve to cast michael keaton as batman , and now they think they can get away with making him second banana to the joker ! ! \" and , indeed , this situation would have been altogether inappropriate and intolerable were it not for the fact that someone at warner brothers had the savvy to cast jack nicholson in the role he was born to play . nicholson deserves the top billing he is receiving in the posters and opening credits since his astounding , oscar - worthy performance as the joker is the highlight of batman . nicholson shows no inhibition or shame as he pulls out all the stops to create a joker that makes cesar romero look like bozo the clown ( romero played the joker in the \\' 60s tv series ) . on one hand , nicholson \\' s joker is extremely funny . his murderous escapades and manic outbursts ( which include defacing paintings in an art museum and invading the television airwaves with hilarious pirate broadcasts ) bring humor and laughter into an otherwise dark film . but on the other hand , his outwardly jovial disposition is only a mask for his intense contempt for all of mankind . the joker \\' s cruelty and demented , diabolical nature are truly frightening and sinister . this guy is off his rocker , and he not only knows it , he flaunts it ! but enough about nicholson as the joker : i \\' m sure most people are wondering about michael keaton as batman . like many , i was outraged when warner brothers announced that keaton had been cast as the caped crusader . but batfans need not worry because holy unconventional casting ! keaton delivers . he is convincing as the tormented millionaire , bruce wayne , and beneath his hard , black body armor , he is mysterious and formidable as the batman . even though the screenplay only halfheartedly attempts to develop the character , keaton manages to give hints of the inner turmoil and emotional rage that drive wayne to don his bat gear and battle the low life scum of gotham city . visually , batman is a knockout nothing short of a triumph for director tim burton and his production team . the movie successfully captures the film noir look and bleak , gloomy atmosphere of such batman comic books as \" the dark knight returns \" and \" the killing joke . \" burton \\' s film is a feast for the eyes ; the $ 35 million budget is definitely on the screen . the sets , costumes , and make - up are stunning and worthy of oscar nominations . nicholson isn \\' t joking when he boasts , \" wait \\' till they get a load of me ! \" his grimacing smile , green hair , and purple suits over orange shirts are colorful and outrageous . keaton \\' s wardrobe is equally appropriate . batman \\' s cape , mask , and body armor make him look threatening , frightening , and invincible bringing to mind not adam west \\' s campy costume in the tv series but peter weir \\' s outfit in robocop . production designer anton furst \\' s sets are a wonder . gotham city is dark and foreboding , almost as if it were an expressionist vision of new york . the batcave is cold , bare , and desolate . the world that burton and furst have created in batman is a melancholy nightmare of violence and corruption . the movie \\' s gritty bladerunner / robocop look is a joy to behold . the plot , on the other hand , is not as rousing . the screenplay is not up to snuff in comparison to the stylized sets and superb acting . it takes forever for what little story there is to finally kick into gear . batman tries to walk a thin line between action and character psychology , but it fails to give us enough of either one . as i mentioned earlier , the screenplay gives us plenty of the joker , but it never fully establishes batman \\' s psychological motives and underpinnings . in terms of action , batman is not as thrilling as you might expect . burton seems more concerned with the visual and dramatic elements of the story . more than anything , batman is a mood film . while batman may not completely absorb and excite you , it will likely impress you with its success at bringing to life the style and spirit of the batman comic books . thanks to its distinctive look , the movie like a good comic book transports us to another world .',\n",

it is possible to like a film that focuses on grime and sick behaviour ( ie . \" se7en \" ) , but it takes a large measure of restraint ( schumacher has none ) and a larger amount of talent ( schumacher has little ) . by those jabs , i \\' m not only referring to his stylish destruction of the \" batman \" franchise , but \" a time to kill \" was an immensely overrated disappointment . for a guy who gets so much studio money , his track record of making rather bad movies is unparalleled . a good screenwriter and a good director can make you hypnotically watch even disgusting subject matter . writer andrew kevin walker didn \\' t recapture the smarts of the fascinating script he authored for \\' 95s twisted thriller , \" se7en \" . director schumacher doesn \\' t have that innate ability to make you watch things you don \\' t really want to see like better directors are capable of doing . he must not have believed hitchcock who espoused the theory that what we don \\' t see is more frightening than what we do ( especially when it \\' s a scene where young girl is supposed to be murdered ) . however , gratuitous is joel \\' s middle name . he must think that not flaunting a hard - core act of violent sex is showing plenty of tactful restraint . no , he doesn \\' t go that far , but we see enough unpleasantness . he doesn \\' t leave much to the imagination . it \\' s manipulating to hurt ( or kill ) young girls just to get the audience on the side of a murderous vigilante . the script and acting should be what gets us to believe in these characters , yet schumacher has no subtlety in his ( ha ha ! ) craft . case in point , a shot of a christian fellowship bus ( good , right ? ) drives away to reveal one of the villains ( bad , right ? ) . see . . . no subtlety . does joel think we \\' re stupid or that we need to be held by the hand to comprehend the contrasting imagery ? who do we root for in this mess ? is there anybody out there ? it \\' s not all the director \\' s fault , though . why did the actors sign up for this ? nicolas cage is an oscar - winner , for cryin \\' out loud ! if he claims to do films to challenge himself and for the artistic merit rather than the money , what was he smoking when this script dropped on his veranda ? what is cage supposed to be in this movie -- a whispering batman without the charisma and pointed ears ? villainous peter stormare is five steps past hammy . and what is james gandolfini doing in this trash ? he was so solid as a concerned father in \" a civil action \" . i guess ol \\' nic , pete , and jim were promised a mountain of money . . . or they \\' re suckers . or they just don \\' t care . there are moments ( albeit brief ones ) where this rises above the wasteland . catherine keener is good ( although too quick to threaten divorce ) as mrs . wells . baby cindy is obviously cute and wells \\' devout love of his daughter is sweet . the mother ( amy norton ) of the girl in the infamous 8mm film is not too bad as a woman dealing with the uncertain loss of her runaway daughter . this film has an appropriate blue - toned , washed - out look like \" payback \" ( which was a much better movie ) . the editing is okay in scenes of no dialogue , but at other times it \\' s rough . during some conversations , close - ups and wide shots are not cut very well , making it look to be editted by someone whose instincts aren \\' t good and whose timing was a half - second off . such a technical error indeed stands out . speaking of standing out , don \\' t believe the misleading trailers . there \\' s not much action here . occasionally , yes , but not as often as your tv will have you believe . after seeing \" 8mm \" , i may not be interested in ever watching any kind of porn again . is that a positive ? well , if making me almost ill at the thought of glimpsing a dirty movie again is their motive , they \\' ve done a swell job here . it \\' ll be a long time before i give a schumacher film another chance -- unless i lose my mind and become seriously depraved . but today i \\' m not depraved , so i ask , why does this film preach that this garbage is out there and that society should be worried about it ? i \\' m sure that somewhere right now there \\' s some pretty sick crap going on , but that doesn \\' t mean i need to know about it . yes , mr . walker , your script tells us that there are some screwed - up folks out there . yes , mr . walker , the proverbial monster doesn \\' t look like we expect him to . you said all that in 1995 . move on . this film serves no purpose . it doesn \\' t entertain , it doesn \\' t teach us anything , it doesn \\' t make a statement beyond the obvious \" this stuff is bad \" approach . only if this film awakens the authorities to find a way to abolish these types of horrors would it ever do someting truly worthwhile . that \\' s not likely to happen , though , so \" 8mm \" is indeed a scummy waste of money . orson welles said years ago in a tribute to film , \" to movies . . . to good movies \" . if only joel schumacher and the producers had listened and told andrew kevin walker to bury this crud deep in a hole . like \" snuff \" films , \" 8mm \" should never have been made . now , excuse me while i go try to forget i ever saw it . useless trivia -- joel schumacher loves the vigilante theme . he used it in \" batman forever \" , in \" batman & robin \" , in \" a time to kill \" , in \" falling down \" , and it \\' s rumoured that joel himself will play the vigilante at his breakfast table tomorrow . . .',\n",

' . of course , this prompts the scene unfairly exposed in the trailers , in which jim and a freshly baked pie have a very intimate moment in the kitchen corner . there are many moments , such as this , in which director paul weitz uses a game - plan similar to the one frequently displayed in mary : to cause the audience to break down laughing in disgusting disbelief . american pie is a hard - fought effort that has replenishing rewards if you manage to stick with it . i loved the young cast in this movie . consider the subject matter that these actors have dealt with , obviously suggestiveness never rivaled in any of their previous projects , and you should appreciate their performances . biggs is more than enjoyable , and chris klein ( who recently played a similar jock in election ) is obviously a young talent on the rise . but in a teen - dominated movie , the best performance comes from comedian eugene levy ( of television ' s sctv ) , who is unexpectedly brilliant as jim ' s uneasy father . scenes in which the familiar father - son conversations are brought to interesting new levels are the funniest moments to be found in american pie . after levy discovers jim ' s new use for apple pie , he tells him , ` i did a fare share of that sort of thing when i was your age . but i never used baked goods . ' it is performances such as his , and bill murray ' s in rushmore , that are often unfairly dismissed when awards are handed out . there are some less - than - original aspects of the film . a bathroom incident involving finch and a bottle of ex - lax is something we ' ve seen before . if weitz is planning to take after the farrelly brothers , then this is a decidedly unwise move : the same prank was pulled in the brother ' s dumb and dumber , and used to greater effect . secondly , the characters are forced into a half - hearted climax that seems more artificial than amusing . but at one point , in which we discover that american pie does have a heart of it ' s own , biggs asks his buddies why he ' s going through so much pressure for something that ' s ` not very important anyway . ' and so we realize that while the film is expressive about a subject that is hardly appropriate , it still manages to be mature . in it ' s own way .\",\n",

for shyamalan , the answer must have come as easy to him as nuclear physics does to kindergartners . does this new film measure up to his breakthrough box office smash , though ? the answer to that question is not a very easy one , either . as far as pacing goes , the sixth sense seemed almost interminable . it wasn \\' t until the surprise ending was revealed that i realized the film was actually intentionally ( and perfectly ) paced in order to give the audience ample time to re - connect all of the information they had seen once the climax had been reached . for unbreakable , shyamalan gave the film a much more satisfying pace which , in many ways , blows away the film that had come before . the story moves along at a steady pace and shyamalan \\' s direction is excellent , with the camera almost constantly moving . there are tons of great shots in the film , not least of which is a conversation that opens the film between willis \\' character and another train passenger . the shot seems as though it were filmed like we were watching the two talk from between the train seats and the camera steadily glides back and forth between the two actors as they speak . also very impressive is the film \\' s score by james newton howard ( who also scored shyamalan \\' s sixth sense and the similar film stir of echoes , as well as this year \\' s dinosaur ) . several of the scenes are driven by a very catchy beat and help to increase the tempo of the film . one of the best examples of this is a scene in which dunne goes into a train station to \" exercise \" his powers . the music , in combination with the stellar visuals , really go a long way towards making this an incredible movie . if there was any one soundtrack i would make a must purchase this year , this one would be it . the film also boasts some great performances , including a precocious child actor trying to vie for the oscar throne left vacant by haley joel osment . willis turns in a great performance as the sad sack dunne , who just can \\' t seem to figure out why he \\' s been depressed for the last few years . his character almost seems pathetic when we first meet him , but he eventually grows into his own under elijah \\' s tutelage . jackson is one of the better actors of our time , and here he turns in yet another great performance as the ever injured elijah . though his hairstyle is absurd , jackson seems to infuse such a great deal of pain into his role that the mortar board hairdo can easily be overlooked . robin wright penn \\' s role seems slightly underwritten , but she still manages to get across the intense hurt of her character \\' s need for love from her husband and her desire to make things work again . spencer treat clark , as the dunne \\' s young son jeremy , shows that shyamalan still has a knack for picking young actors , and he turns in one of the most competent performances in the film . out of all the characters , jeremy \\' s is perhaps the most emotional , and clark does a great job with the role . where the film does lose points though , is during its \" surprise \" ending . shyamalan has said in interviews that he was going to do an ending that blew away the one presented by the sixth sense , but i found myself saying \" that was it ? ! \" when unbreakable revealed its own ending . it \\' s not that the ending is bad , it \\' s just that the ending doesn \\' t quite have the emotional punch that the other film \\' s did . plus , it almost seems like it sets itself up for sequels ( and i won \\' t reveal the ending here , but you \\' ll understand what i mean when you see it ) . essentially , what all of this means is that shyamalan has made another good film with unbreakable . the only real problem is that the ending doesn \\' t quite fill the shadow left by its predecessor . as long as it isn \\' t held to the standard that sixth sense set ( which it ultimately will be ) , it should be a remarkably well liked film . one thing seems clear , though . shyamalan definitely has an affinity for comic books that he would like to share with the world and many comic book fans will also delight the vision he presents in this film .',\n",

              " ('when i was growing up in 1970s , boys in my school used to divide into two groups , based on their action movies preferences . the first one , myself included , liked movies that featured spectacular car chases , lots of machinegun fire and huge explosions . the latter one preferred hong kong martial arts flicks , probably because they could ( or , to be more precise , thought they could ) imitate its stunts in the real life . decades later , while refining my own cinematic taste , i began to appreciate and actually like those movies , probably because of overexposure to shoot - em - up idiocy of 1980s ramboids . yes , most of the kung fu and other \" martial arts \" flicks were cheap , they had predictable and formulaic plot , and asked very little of production values aside from martial arts skills . but , in the same time , those movies had their own rules and in the hands of capable director could become a terrific guilty pleasure and source of relaxation . the best of those movies , one that passed the test of time and managed to keep its own cult status after quarter of century was enter the dragon . made in 1973 in a joint hong kong - hollywood venture , it was intended to bring bruce lee \\' s skills and kung fu philosophy to the western audience . it succeeded , but it is still debatable whether by its own merit or by the unfortunate and mysterious death of bruce lee that immortalised the myth about that actor . lee plays a quiet shaolin monk who is a martial arts expert . he is approached by interpol official who asks him to join tri - annual martial arts tournament that is held on a remote island , owned and controlled by han , renegade shaolin monk . interpol suspects that the martial arts business is just cover for narcotics , gun - running and prostitution operations and lee must find the evidence necessary for authorities to intervene . lee accepts the mission because of personal reasons - o \\' harra , han \\' s brutal bodyguard was responsible for the tragic death of lee \\' s sister years ago . the island is also destination of two colourful martial arts experts from us - williams ( played by jim kelly ) is black activist running from the racist police , and his friend roper wants to make money in order to pay gambling debts . the plot of enter the dragon was in many ways influenced by james bond ( the 007 franchise itself would return favour by using kung fu elements in the man with the golden gun two years later ) . the main hero was faced against a power - hungry megalomaniac on a remote island , alone against whole army of bad guys . on the other hand , lee was more believable hero than bond ; deprived of guns and super - tech gadgets , he had to rely only on his personal skills in order to survive . in the same time , the plot , although extremely thin , allowed him even some internal battles - between the natural instinct to avenge his sister and his own anti - violent philosophy . the latter provided some opportunities to evaluate lee \\' s acting skills and some new elements to his impressive screen presence . although two other main actors - john saxon being the obligatory good white guy and jim kelly being the obligatory black good guy - were intended to share top spot with lee , they served as nothing more than a comic relief . it is a real shame to see kelly , definitely the worse actor than saxon , to steal the scenes from him only because his lines , being the worst possible blaxploitation cliches , sound so damn over the top . other actors , not including shih kien who turns han into typical , although not very convincing bondian villain , are nothing more than fist fodder for bruce lee ( among them is young jackie chan ) . fighting scenes are still impressive today as they were 25 years ago , although they mostly lack gore associated with that genre . in many way they are also more realistic ( they were personally staged by lee himself ) , demanding only a blow or two to incapacitate or kill the opponent . i \\' m not a martial arts expert nor the martial arts fan , but comparing those scenes with typical scenes today i simply can \\' t avoid to appreciate the difference from today \\' s movie fights when masses of bloody pulp manage to get up from the floor and win in the end . so , despite all the obvious flaws that preclude this movie of being top 100 of all times , enter the dragon is a incredibly entertaining piece of cinema and the martial arts flick that can be enjoyed even by those who don \\' t like that particular genre .',\n",

the film introduces us two three different characters who , in the beginning , are considered outsiders because they \\' re not ( yet ) part of this clique : the new kid , steve ( james marsden - dull dull dull dull ) , who \\' s having trouble at home because he hasn \\' t gotten over his brother \\' s ( ethan embry , in quick flashes so you don \\' t recognize him - i did ) suicide ; the renegade girl , rachel ( katie holmes , from \" dawson \\' s creek \" ) , who \\' s chief personality trait is her prominent nose ring ; and by far the most interesting kid , gavin ( nick stahl , the kid from \" the man without a face \" ) , who \\' s the most interesting because he \\' s the only character who \\' s given some dimension . in the film \\' s best scene , he introduces steve to every single clique , nailing each one \\' s fetishes and hang - ups , and it \\' s the best scene in the movie because it \\' s witty , satirical , and interesting - something the rest of this film isn \\' t . gavin suspects there \\' s something awry with the preppie kids , known as the blue ribbons , and in the tradition of all conspirators , and even when he actually shows hard pure evidence to steve , he \\' s only treated as a typical raving conspiracy buff . here , we have another case of \" the idiot plot , \" where not only could steve had done something about gavin and what happens to him , but he may have saved this film from being the dreary , dull film that it is without gavin , who gives it life and humor . the only other half - interesting character is the school janitor , played by william sadler as a retarded , scary guy who may not be what he seems to be . . . but really , we don \\' t care anyway . i probably shouldn \\' t mention that this was directed by david nutter , who \\' s works for \" the x - files , \" because that would probably tarnish his reputation . like the show , he \\' s good at setting up weird conspiracies , and creating a general creepy feel . most of this film is shot at night and with dark eerie shadows for the maximum creepy effect , and some of it works . but what this film is not so good at is coming out with a good payoff . he keeps too much inside , so much that when the characters journey to a mental institution in the third act , you wonder why they just don \\' t get the hell out of there . i think what happens to gavin is proof enough that there \\' s something rotten in the state of teen angstdom . what this film needs to be is a lot longer , a lot more colorful , and a lot creepier . if the best villain they can come up with is a guidance counselor ( played by bruce greenwood , an atom egoyan regular obviously just trying to pay the rent ) who still thinks he can get away with it even when most is revealed , then they need to come up with a tougher , smarter villain . if he \\' s so villainous , then why could two dense teenagers who couldn \\' t figure out there was something going on until it was way too late find information on him in a couple minutes ? the film , which runs about 80 or so minutes , just needs to work on these things , and become a lot less sloppy . at such a short running time and with such lame , boring characters as these , it \\' s pretty much obvious that leaving this film leaves a horribly unsatisfied taste in one \\' s mouth , especially mine .',\n",

              " ('jackie brown entered theaters with little fanfare and a lot of expectation . even though advance publicity on this one was fairly limited , the audiences waited for the showings with heightened anticipation . this is , after all , the first movie quentin tarantino has directed since the highly touted pulp fiction . to say he has been inactive in between would be to tell a falsehood , since he has been involved in such projects as destiny turns on the radio , desperado , four rooms , and from dusk \\' til dawn . he was also called in at the last minute to help punch up the screenplay for crimson tide . ( i \\' m willing to wager the debate over which silver surfer is the only true silver surfer was penned by him . ) tarantino contributed on and off screen to these films , but never took the director \\' s helm . nearly four years since gaining notoriety on the hollywood scene and making john travolta a star once more , tarantino returns with a film he can call his own . the film opens up with an homage to the graduate , with jackie brown ( pam grier ) on one of those airport people movers as the credits are displayed in front of her . jackie is a flight attendant for air cabo , which flies back and fourth between los angeles and cabo san lucas . this makes jackie a convenient cash courier for gun dealer ordell robbi ( samuel l . jackson ) who is currently keeping his money stashed in mexico . however , while bringing fifty thousand dollars back into the u . s . for ordell , jackie is apprehended by fbi agent mark dargus ( michael bowen ) and atf agent ray nicolet ( michael keaton ) , who catch her not only with the money , but with a bonus of a couple of ounces of illicit drugs . jackie didn \\' t know they were in the package with the cash , but that \\' s of no consequence to the authorities , who threaten jackie with a couple of years hard time if convicted . of course , dargus and nicolet are just using the sentence to get jackie to turn over the big fish , ordell . ordell uses honest bail bondsman max cherry ( robert forster ) to get jackie out of jail , but while max is immediately attracted to her , jackie is more concerned about her immediate safety , since ordell killed the last one of his operatives who got picked up by the police . sure enough , ordell shows up at jackie \\' s apartment that evening and tries to silence jackie for good , but she \" borrows \" max \\' s pistol and manages to turn the tables on ordell . instead of closing the irony circle and relocating a bullet from the pistol \\' s chamber to ordell \\' s head , jackie proposes a deal . since ordell wants to get his money out of mexico , jackie will get back up to her old tricks and be a courier for him once more , but this time for a more substantial fee : fifteen percent of ordell \\' s half million dollars . with a gun in his face , how can ordell not agree ? by itself , this premise might have been interesting enough to carry the film . however , we are also introduced to a number of double crosses which make us pay attention and think . jackie claims to be bringing the money in for ordell , but she \\' s also making a deal with the feds as well as with max . the film throws us off every once in a while by leading us to believe the deal we thought was authentic is actually a sham , but it is in no way done to the extent that we feel jerked around . instead , it \\' s actually a nice departure from the predictability which is prevalent in so many of today \\' s movies . at least this film has a little imagination . most of the performances in jackie brown are above par . pam grier , of whom i had never taken notice before , plays jackie with a mix of confidence and vulnerability which makes her character believable . samuel l . jackson has a kind of mesmerizing quality about him as he handles himself in situations where you know he is in total control . robert forster is thoroughly likable because he comes across as such an honest guy , trying to do his best . . never mind that he belongs to a profession where sneaking into a guy \\' s apartment to zap him with a stun gun is simply a matter of course . he \\' s just so down - to - earth , the nature of his job really doesn \\' t occur to us , even when we \\' re shown him bringing a handcuffed woman to prison , or when we see the tools of his trade . in supporting roles are robert de niro as louis gara , a recently paroled friend of ordell \\' s , and bridget fonda as melanie , one of the girls ordell keeps around town . unfortunately , de niro is basically wasted as his lines are few and far between , and then they are mostly clipped sentences . in this film , he \\' s not really de niro , but stereotypical de niro , uttering things like , \" little bit , \" and \" pretty much . \" fonda , on the other hand , plays the slightly spaced - out melanie with satisfactory relish and cuteness , such that even when she is annoying louis , we are taking her side . as is characteristic of any film in which tarantino has had a hand , the dialog is quick and snappy . it grabs our attention and is actually interesting , and in many respects , this makes jackie brown a film which needs few visuals ; the lines are a form of art in and amongst themselves . don \\' t count tarantino out when it comes to using the camera , however . there \\' s a scene where max is unwittingly watching a dry run of a money exchange , and he \\' s not really sure what \\' s happening , but by composing the scene just so , his realization of what \\' s going on is felt simultaneously by the audience . we look at the screen and think , \" gee , that \\' s clever , \" and then think the same thing about how the film induced us into that wonderful feeling of catching on . although tarantino isn \\' t afraid to drag out a shot for dramatic effect , it unfortunately works to varying degrees in this film . there are shots where a character is simply driving , and we watch this person and somehow get an idea of what is going on in his or her head . this is a tribute to both direction and acting . however , there is at least one other scene where we follow jackie through a mall , and she is looking for something ; desperately looking for something . we get the idea of the frantic nature of her search , but we follow her for so long that we end up not really caring about what she \\' s looking for , but instead hoping she \\' ll just stop . overall , viewing jackie brown is time spent well . some flap has already been made about the language used in the film , but it \\' s really not much worse than many of the other movies out there today . in fact , one might even be able to say that the way in which these \" offensive \" words are employed almost cause them to parody themselves and therefore transcend their own offensiveness . go see the film and see what i mean .',\n",

              " ('i wish i could say that there is something more to the new star wars installment than what you see in the commercials , but there isn \\' t . george lucas is an expert at crafting triumphant , special effects - bound flicks and he has done it again . this is the first star wars film i \\' ve seen on the big screen , so , of course , the impact was much greater than when i watched the three original episodes on video . what is compelling about the phantom menace is not its disposable story , but its amazing visuals . basically , the film \\' s plot is centered around trade disputes between two planets . qui - gon ( liam neeson ) and his young apprentice obi - wan kenobi ( ewan mcgregor ) set out with the animated jar - jar binks to fix the mess that may result in war . when their ship breaks down and they are stranded , they find a young boy , anakin skywalker ( jake lloyd ) and his slave mother . qui - gon strongly believes that anakin is destined for jedi greatness and immediately takes him under his wing . anakin participates in a heart - pounding podrace , one of the highlights of the film , to get the equipment needed to fix qui - gon \\' s ship . however , most everyone is doubtful about entrusting the future to some unknown slave boy . meanwhile , queen amadala ( natalie portman ) is frustrated and at wit \\' s end , being na ? ve and young and having so much responsibility on her shoulders . there are hardly any emotional scenes in the film - even when we discover that anakin will be leaving his slave mother behind to begin jedi training , the frenzied excitement of the whole film wears down the poignancy to the size of a crumb . this does not prove that the phantom menace is poorly made for it is brilliantly made . in all the star wars films , human emotions that we , the audience , can identify with are usually nil , but the films are for pure enjoyment , not for uplifting purposes . despite the fun of watching the movie , the phantom menace is not without flaws . for starters , we have the ill - conceived , moronic character jar - jar binks who should be considered a threat to star wars galactic society and to the audience . what a klutz ! george lucas clumsily tried to create a fun character that would be as memorable as , say , yoda , r2 - d2 , or c3 - po , but , alas , his efforts were in vain . secondly ( this may be good or bad , depending on your point of view ) , the movie \\' s atmosphere is so different from the familiar comic - book feel of the previous three star wars installments . this is due , perhaps , to the utter complexity to this movie \\' s plot and the higher level of sophistication of the visual effects used here . the movie seems to be reaching for epic proportions . i can \\' t say much about the acting , though acting has never been what you saw star wars movies for anyway . however , there is absolutely no pizzazz to the performances - they are straightforward and , at times , stale . natalie portman has a great presence , but her turn as queen amadala makes the queen a stoic , unfeeling ? enigma . there is nothing we can hold onto in her performance to make us believe the trade predicament is anything of importance . jake lloyd is the only actor here who has an ounce of evident spunk . despite the inevitable faults , there is so much to enjoy about the movie . the heightened excitement of the final sequences doesn \\' t quite surpass the famous the empire strikes back climactic scenes , but they are amazing and edge - of - your - seat fun in their own rite . the film is a treasure to look at . the visual effects are astonishing 99 . 8 % of the time - the awe - inspiring , mouth - opening , eye - popping sight of the underwater city is nothing short of production design and special effects genius . not since 1997 \\' s the fifth element has there been a film as drenched in visual treats as this one . the production design is reminiscent of the fifth element , the previous star wars movies , kubrick \\' s 2001 , maybe even of fritz lang \\' s classic silent metropolis . however , all the sets are so original . the original star wars movies can \\' t even match the grandeur of this film \\' s visuals and that is a sheer pleasure for the viewer - it gives us hope of even greater things for the upcoming episode . the costumes are remarkable and have jean - paul gaultier written all over them . whether its queen amadala \\' s gigantic wardrobe complete with gold - embroidery and feathers , or the jedis \\' simple brown uniforms , the costume designer has fused talent with outrageousness . the costumes are one of the true delights of watching the movie . as for john williams \\' score , i don \\' t think he \\' s done one as complex or powerful since ? i can \\' t even remember . it is as epic as his schindler \\' s list score and as thrilling and zestful as jaws . it includes the bare bones of his music from the previous three films , but williams has added on , made the music much more intense and moving . what with the overwhelming hoopla that circled this movie , one might come in with high expectations and be disappointed . there is very little to hate in the film : it \\' s a very accomplished and skillfully made flick . it is the best \" fun \" film and the best big - budget film out today , most definitely .',\n",

the - aliens \\'- asses \" style . id4 had this same style , except it was forced , most likely the cause of will smith having a major role . this new \" star wars \" has a very simple , basic plot : mankind vs . an alien species . the alien species in question here is the bugs , a seemingly advanced civilization of arachnid - type insects . however , the underlying morals of starship troopers are fleshed out with deadly accuracy . sometimes the morals are buried by the bloody violence and intense action scenes , but during quiet moments , we realize that starship troopers has something to tell us about our civilization . more than likely , these morals will be overpowered and quickly forgotten by the time the movie ends . and they should be . i doubt verhoeven intended this film to be a thought - provoking film . this is an \" event \" film , but surprisingly above average . it is extremely refreshing to watch a sci - fi war film , and actually root for the human side ( something independence day never achieved ) . starship troopers begins with a satirical portrayal of those strange \" join the army \" ads . mixing a web - based interface , these summations of events are refreshingly original . stating , \" would you like to know more ? \" , these short news bulletins give the film an immediate sense of humor , and we know we should not take it seriously . however , we also witness the murder of several troopers in battle , in a gory , yet funny , way . after witnessing the slaughter , the film jumps back one year , to setup what we just saw . we are introduced to johnny rico ( casper van dien ) and carmen ibanez ( denise richards ) . rico flirts with carmen by sending her messages over computer terminals in school classrooms . however , carmen isn \\' t as interested in rico as she is in becoming a pilot . however , another classmate , dizzy flores ( dina meyer ) , has her eye on rico . unfortunately , rico isn \\' t interested in dizzy . this setup is rather cliched , as is the result of the setup , but it still is fun to watch . carmen signs up to become a starship trooper , and as a result , rico signs up . and as a result , dizzy signs up . everyone is assigned a certain position in the academy : carmen gets the pilot position she wanted , carl jenkins ( neil patrick harris ) , a psychic , gets a position in the training program , and rico is left in the lowest class of the starship troopers : the mobile infantry . the main story follows rico through his trials and relationships . in reality , i found myself watching a space version of \" melrose place , \" but with better special effects . an hour into the film , the war begins . a sense of tension grew in the audience i watched this film with . the first hour may have been a funny ( sometimes unintentionally ) setup , but we grew to care for the flat characters , because no matter how hard i tried not to like the characters , their gorgeous looks won me over ( call me superficial , if you must ) . following the training sessions , which had many dramas in themselves ( too many to mention here ) , the troopers are sent to war . the bugs live on the planet klendathu , a planet which consists of dirt and rock , and pretty much nothing else . many dramas occur during the war , until finally the troopers realize that their is something behind the bugs \\' attacks . a sort of intelligence which masterminds the defense . the troopers are ordered to locate the \" brain \" and capture it . i hopefully left the plot as vague as possible , because starship troopers is not about plot . it \\' s about special effects and gory violence . director verhoeven , most known for his nudie film showgirls and basic instinct , returns to his sci - fi days , which gave us good films like total recall . verhoeven likes to push the envelope of the mpaa , but despite all the violence , the comic book feel gives the film a sense of falsehood . starship troopers is extremely violent , with more gore than this year \\' s event horizon . the r rating is well deserved , and hopefully parents will not allow their 12 year old children to see it . my guess is that verhoeven \\' s target audience is the 18 to 25 male group . the film has a testosterone level off the charts , with chiseled men and beautiful women . despite these superficial elements , starship troopers also creates a world which made star wars so successful . while watching the film , we never second guess the character \\' s decisions because they seem perfectly clear . thankfully , no hero is punching aliens in the face , which gives the flat characters some depth for which we can identify with . the cast of starship troopers is quite annoying to begin with , but they soon grow on you . casper van dien has the chiseled facial features and tan skin which will make most girls swoon . to most guys , he will come across as artificial . fortunately , van dien is the worst of the cast , despite how hard he tries to come off as a real character . dina meyer does a much better job of fleshing out her character . her dizzy is extremely likeable . denise richards also does a good job , and her scenes are very well done . jake busey , gary busey \\' s son , gives a wonderfully funny performance , and provides one of the biggest laughs of the film . neil patrick harris ( remember , he was doogie howser ) is a little wooden , and slightly out of place with the rest of the cast . however , he does give a good performance . michael ironside gives the best performance of the film as the teacher with one arm . his performance rises above the rest . perhaps it is because his character is the most developed , but i think it is just ironside \\' s presence on screen . unfortunately , no particular cast member gives a star - making performance , which is too bad because the material here could have made many of the cast members stars . director verhoeven is the main star of the film . his direction is fast and unrelentless . he never slows down his pace , which makes for a wild ride . writer edward neumeier adapted the screenplay from the book by robert heinlein . the writing is usually very funny , and sometimes very corny . the dialogue is smart but not too smart . we aren \\' t required to know everything , but some plot holes are left unanswered . thankfully we are not intended to notice , and we really don \\' t ( except for one which lingered in my mind for quite a while ) . amazingly , with all the wars and romance going on , the screenplay manages to include some surprising governmental issues . in fact , these governmental changes seem fairly plausible , and this adds another layer to the story . the moral debate of the characters is quite surprising to find in a film of this genre , but what is even more surprising is the amount of humor included into all the carnage . i haven \\' t laughed this loud , even in some comedies . oh , and the special effects are first rate . starship troopers is rated r for graphic sci - fi violence and gore , and for some language and nudity . believe me when i say this : don \\' t take young kids to see this film . it is extremely violent . in fact , it is probably the most violent film out this year . however , if you are old enough ( over 17 ) to see it , starship troopers is guaranteed to entertain . it \\' s been a long time since i have cheered for the heros , while also cheering for the bad guys . and still , it is my dream to see a sci - fi film in which the alien race destroys mankind , and take over the world . now that would be entertaining !',\n",

then there \\' s \" caligula . \" this film features incest , necrophilia , beastuality , anal rape , homosexual felatio of both sexes , elaborate and lengthy orgies , a greased - up fist forced up a man \\' s rear , wine poured down a man who \\' s had his urinary tracts tied off , a penis chopped off and fed to hungry dogs , etc , etc , etc . this could very well be a respectable film , and if could have been had the following not occurred : a ) the events were graphically shot in clear view ; b ) the tone was not that of trying to shock comically but to , well , show \" historical accuracy ; \" c ) the film was a 20 million dollar production with lavish sets , a rather impressive cast , and a whopping 2 1 / 2 hour running time . produced and funded by none other than bob guccione , owner of penthouse magazine , \" caligula \" comes across as the most hysterical dramatic picture since \" plan 9 from outer space \" because underneath there \\' s a sense that everything this film is doing is not only accurate and justified , but also brilliantly entertaining . after all , it \\' s not really the fact that this film features the aforementioned disgusting moments , but that it actually believes in them as dramatic weaponry . no film should be discarded because its content , because film is never about what it \\' s about , it \\' s about how it \\' s about ( as the old cliche goes ) . those who bash this film for content are glancing over the biggest and most obvious problem with \" caligula , \" and that \\' s that it \\' s nothing but overdramaticized bullshit from start to finish , without a second of credibility in its mammoth running time . \" caligula \" allegedly tells the true story of the evil roman emporer of the same name , a man who was so insanely decadent that his assasination came as a blessing . . . or so i guess , even though almost every single roman emporer was assasinated as well and for much the same reasons . the film opens on the wrong note , of course , with a quote from mark appearing before any image graces the screen , using the over - used passage \" what shall it profit a man if he should gain the whole world an dlose his own soul , \" depite the fact that the opening scene of the film is of the emporer before he was an emporer , fucking around with his own sister in a field ( i suppose if one has to lose their soul , one has to have a soul in the first place ) . the plot is so incomprehensibly done that all i or anyone else can make out of it is that caligula ( disastrously played by the great malcom mcdowell , a performance that does the opposite that his performance in \" a clockwork orange \" did ) is next in line for the throne but can \\' t wait for the current emporer , tiberius ( peter o \\' toole - ditto , only for his performance in \" lawrence of arabia \" ) , his grandfather , to die . . . so he kills him and ascends to the throne . then he abuses his position , marries a woman ( helen mirren , who retains her dignity as an actor by not exactly acting ) so he doesn \\' t just have to sleep with his sister ( a dreadful teresa ann savoy , there to be pretty , naked , and willing to hop in the sack with mac or anyone he asks her to hop in with ) , abuses his position a little more , a little more , and a little more , and then , i believe , invades england , then is killed off . the filler , instead of recounting his life , is supposed to be , as guccione claims , the ultimate portrait of decadent pagan rome , complete with orgies , vicious deaths , and lots of nudity . but instead of being the historical accurate film it really really wants to be , it instead becomes guccione \\' s twisted masturbatory image of what it could be like . oh , isn \\' t it great that they just loved having sex ? and that they killed people so disgustingly ? and wouldn \\' t it be great if i could make a couple bucks by selling this shit off as accuracy even though it \\' s so blatantly real bad porn that i \\' ve completely convinced myself that it \\' s not . i mean , why not just show a roman orgy when i can spend a good ten minutes examining every single facet that makes it up . and it \\' s not just that it \\' s disgusting or vile or whatever adjective you want to use to describe this film - it \\' s that in a film where the entire feel it \\' s going for isn \\' t felt , it \\' s also the sloppiest expensive movie of all time . the sets are lavish , but so blatantly innacurate that i wonder if no historian wanting to have his name on this film explains this . but that doesn \\' t matter since the cinematography is so dark that you wonder if a light meter was used at all , making this not only dark and ugly , but just plain dark . the camera operation is also the worst i \\' ve ever seen in my entire life . not only does this film hold the record for the most unnecessary zooms in one single shot ever , but often the camera will lose its subjects and pan around till they find them , then have them out of focus . the editing is so sloppy that some scenes are absolutely impossible to follow . there is no writer to speak of ( what the hell does it mean that it \\' s \" adapted from an original screenplay by gore vidal ? \" ) , but nevertheless , the dialogue is shit , so laughably bad that i can \\' t in good faith believe that anyone with an iq over 5 could say them with a straight face ( my favorite being the line when caligula inquires the doctor about the health of the dying tiberius : \" he could go at any moment , but with care , he could last a year or so . \" ) the music in this film is mostly prokofiev and khachaturian ( they use his gorgeous \" adagio of spartacus and phrygia , \" ad nauseum ) , used in an attempt to give the film some emotion , but instead feels as if it was shipped in from elsewhere . the orgy scenes ( and one infamous lesbo scene between penthouse pets lori wagner and aneeka dilorenzo ) are the result of reshoots by guccione himself , which are so obviously removed from everything else in this film that it only adds to the embrassment ( every five seconds or so , the film cuts to random nudity , as if it was afraid its audience would forget this film is rated \" x \" ) . john gielgud represents the only voice of sanity , walking around in his brief role as if he was constantly the mantra , \" i \\' m going to kill my agent , i \\' m going to kill my agent . . . \" and so on and so on , for over 2 1 / 2 hours , making \" caligula \" about as exciting and enriching as a three hour college lecture class and twice as deliriously annoying . guccione , in his pursuit of historical accuracy has instead made a film that is such a painstaking , arduous task to watch in its entirety that i doubt anyone can sit through an hour of it without irreversible psychological damage . throughout the entire film , the presence of guccione is easily felt , as if he were standing there at the edge of the screen , pretentiously looking down upon us saying \" look what i can get away with ! and if you don \\' t like this , then you \\' re a prig , and worse than that , you know nothing about history ! \" uh huh . there \\' s a clear difference between historical accuracy and doing something that \\' s artistically good . a film which showed roman decadence as something that was perhaps liberating for some but could not last - that would probably make for a good film . but using historical accuracy as a licence to get away with any kind of disgusting - for - disgustingness \\'- sake acts is total , total bullshit , and all i can say is that guccione and the makers of this film have lost any kind of touch with either entertainment or eroticism , and have developed a pathetic and sadistic taste for both , judging from this film . there \\' s a film that came out in 1989 called \" the cook , the thief , his wife , and her lover , \" a magnifcent film by legendary cult director peter greenaway ( also starring helen mirren ) , which deals with graphic sex , heartstopping violence and gore , and even a little cannibalism for good measure . that film not only never patronized its viewers , but also handled them in a way that was shocking , yes , but also , in a bizarre way , entertaining and totally involving . there were real characters there in a real situation , and best of all passion and just the right amount of restraint as not to get off on the fact that it \\' s going to be offensive to many . that film achieved everything it wanted to do , and has since retained a status as one of those cult films that is not only popular but actualy good . and it \\' s everything \" caligula \" might have been but , alas , wasn \\' t .',\n",

even whit stillman \\' s _the_last_days_of_disco_ , which wasn \\' t so much concerned with disco as it was witty dialogue within a group of hip - to - only - themselves club - hopping preppies , featured at least one extended dance scene . dancing isn \\' t the only thing glazed over in _54_ -- so is the sex , but that may not be entirely christopher \\' s fault . from what i \\' ve heard , his original vision was something considerably more dark and daring , starting with the shane character : he was conceived ( and actually filmed ) as a wild , morally ambiguous bisexual , which would have made an efficient springboard to cover the pansexual pleasure palace aspect of studio 54 \\' s legend . but somewhere between principal photography and the final cut , shane was defanged and quite literally straightened out ; consequently , so was the film . aside from a brief glimpse of erotic encounters toward the beginning of the film , shane \\' s fleeting dalliance with seductive socialite billie ( sela ward ) , and an abbreviated bedhopping montage , the sexual dimension is just about ignored . shane , in this incarnation , is sanitized to the point of blandness , an idealistic do - gooder who pines for a frequent guest at the club , julie black ( campbell ) , a worldly soap star with , yes , a heart of gold . this tacked - on \" romance \" would have been slightly less tedious if either campbell or phillippe made some connection with each other or the audience . they fail on both counts . ultimately , _54_ \\' s failure comes down to three letters : f - u - n . as in , there isn \\' t any to be had for the audience . too much time is spent with the boring shane , and too little is spent on the club floor , where all the action took place . anyhow , though , whatever time is spent on the 54 floor is not used very effectively . when anita finally gets her big break and perform onstage at the club , it should be a euphoric height , for her , the crowd , and the audience ; however , the moment doesn \\' t get a chance to reach that level , for it is cut short by a moment of forced sentimentality , which also mars the film \\' s conclusion ( one of the last - minute reshoots ) . strangely upbeat and wistful , the resolution is wholly unconvincing and unsatisfying . there is an interesting portrait of studio 54 out there -- two of them , in fact -- but _54_ is not one of them . they \\' re on cable tv : a couple of documentaries produced by e ! and vh1 . these two fascinating looks at the club and all the sordid goings - on within it show that there \\' s still a great disco movie to be made . the problem is , after the critical and certain box office failure of _54_ , the subject may have run its hollywood course .',\n",

              " ('since 1990 , the dramatic picture has undergone a certain change of style . now , instead of emphasizing feel - good stories replete with characters of noble virtues , the screenplays and direction point toward human struggle and sorrow . this realist tendancy can be inspiring at times , as 1993 \\' s schindler \\' s list shows . most of today \\' s mainstream drama , however , creates an overabundance of emoting that can turn off members of the audience . that \\' s why pictures like october sky , which are a throwback to the good ol \\' dramas of yesteryear , are such a welcome relief in contemporary cinema . the movie is based on the true story of homer hickam ( jake gyllenhaal ) , a teenager in the 1950 \\' s company town of coalwood , west virginia . it \\' s a well - known fact that the only boys to make a name for themselves are the ones that get out of the town on football scholarships ; the rest grow up to work in the coal mine . the mine , which is run by homer \\' s father ( chris cooper ) , is not the place for homer , however . after watching the soviet satellite sputnik shoot across the october sky in 1957 , homer feels a connection with the outside world -- as he puts it , \" anyone in the world could look up and see the same thing i did . \" drafting two of his best friends and the brainiac outcast , homer begins to construct rockets . with the help of their history teacher , miss riley ( laura dern ) , and several mine workers , the four are soon bound for great things . october sky is a skillfully crafted film , and most of that credit must go to director joe johnston . johnston -- whose career in the film industry includes everything from directing well - known titles like jumanji and the rocketeer down to an uncredited role as a death star trooper in star wars -- certainly knows what he \\' s doing here . he molds characters which are true to life and also fun to watch into a plot that is straightforward and robust . he does not push any barriers , but instead adopts a conservative style of filmmaking which enhances the film \\' s charm . his finesse brings out elements which might otherwise be lost -- such as the relationships between homer and various mine workers , or the silent struggle between homer \\' s mother and father . the cast is well chosen , although the true bright spots are the supporting roles . laura dern ( jurassic park ) lends a strong performance in the role of the history teacher , giving the boys the support and guidance they need . her role is instantly likeable . chris cooper ( the horse whisperer ) , as homer \\' s father , is less likeable -- even downright despicable at times -- but his turn here gives gravity to the movie . he \\' s definitely a driving force in homer \\' s life , and his more humane moments give the piece a certain dynamic that is commendable . the script is generally cheerful , projecting the boys \\' endeavors in a lighthearted manner . there are moments when it becomes predictable -- such as the train tracks scene -- and there are moments when it sacrifices orginality for the need to come up with an emotional plot twist . it highlights the essence of youth , however , and for its exceptional job at this it can be forgiven other missteps . october sky should be a success with audiences . although it doesn \\' t have the appeal of current teen flicks like varsity blues or she \\' s all that , it certainly holds an undeniable quality that older crowds will lean towards . it \\' s a welcome change to the dramatic genre , and one that everyone should see .',\n",

              " ('it \\' s been a good long while since we had a good old fashioned thriller , where mostly everything goes right for the audience and wrong for the characters , but it \\' s been even longer since i saw a thriller that actually * shock * cared for the characters , not merely judged them but actually allowed their human foibles , flaws , and strengths to emerge so radiantly . i \\' d saw that it \\' s been at least a couple decades , even as far back to the great hitchcock thrillers , though i \\' m hardly comparing \" a simple plan \" to , say , \" rear window \" or \" strangers on a train . \" yet it \\' s almost as good . it \\' s simple , yet strangely complex , and astonishingly rewarding , because instead of moving from plot point to plot point , and merely laying out they - might - be - caught overtones , it instead concerns itself with the moral corruption and depths of greed that its protagonists can go to , all without ever judging them as either evil or even immoral . elegantly directed by sam raimi ( yes , the same ) , \" a simple plan \" concerns itself with the discovery of a crashed plane and within a bag full of millions of dollars by an upright , moderately financially stable working man ( bill paxton ) , his dim - witted brother ( billy bob thornton ) , and his drinking buddy ( brent briscoe ) . without anyone around , and the possibility that no one would come looking for it , the three debate and debate but finally reach the decision that yes , they will keep it , but until any authorities or possible owners of the cash come looking , and so they generally don \\' t flaunt anything they don \\' t want to flaunt , they \\' ll keep it stored away in the custody of paxton . the possibilites of this circumstance are much diverse : a ) they could endlessly play cat and mouse with the authorities ; b ) they could try to fight off the rightful owners , who are either villainous or just ; or c ) they could fight amongst themselves . \" a simple plan , \" though borrows a little from each of these . a little tiff with the cops here , a subplot involving an alleged fbi agent ( a chilling gary cole ) there ) , and a bit of inside feuding over here . but , as austin powers would say , that \\' s not necessarily its bag ( baby ) . what i most admired about this film , and what makes this a far superior and unique thriller is that it \\' s successfully able to have its cake and eat it too . it effectively involves some of the traditional thriller cliches , like the ones mentioned above , but at the same time , it involves itself more deeply with the way the characters become morally corrupt and what price they have to pay to have what they think is happiness in a black duffle bag . so while steps are taken to neatly cover things up , and these subsequent steps go miserably awry , the film choses to never loose the sight that in covering things up to the extent that these characters have to , they are slowly losing their souls and their humanity . in one early scene , paxton and thornton have to make a trip back to the plane to return some of the money so it doesn \\' t look like it was all stolen ( not a bad idea ) , when thornton screws up ( as he does continuously throughout the movie ) , and paxton has to do some major covering - up ( read : homicide ) . instead of a quick murder and immeadiate hands - washing , raimi shows a lengthy , painful shot from a low - angle onto paxton \\' s face as he tries to sift through his emotions and reach a conclusion . there \\' s a similar shot afterwards of paxton watching the murder he \\' s committing and taking in all the horror which is also wonderfully effective , but the previous shot is even better : more morally complex and more gut - wrenching . in short , probably the best piece of direction raimi \\' s ever done , demonstrating once again that sometimes the simplest way to do something yields the best results ( for further proof , watch \" persona \" \\' s \" sex scene \" and witness what may be the best scene ingmar bergman \\' s ever done ) . but the film hardly stops here ; it follows completely through and rarely loses sight of its characters humanity and the depletion thereof . yet it also moves from step to step in such a graceful method that we never feel like the film is merely stamping out the plot points of the story . when the time comes for paxton to start becoming selfish and thus diabolical ( with aid from his pregnant wife , played by bridget fonda , a pal to raimi ) , he does , and soon the horror of the situation is escalating to tragic heights . there \\' s at least two grand shootouts , and at least one of them may be one of the greatest shootouts in cinema history , and when they arrive , they don \\' t come with masochistic delight but with cringe - inducing horror . during the one , i was actually sinking into my chair , with the mantra \" they can \\' t do this , can they ? \" streeming through my head . in fact , this film , which is getting many comparisons to the coen \\' s [ superior , but forget about it ] \" fargo , \" has many similar moments of manic insanity , attributed to the major amount of subtlety and restraint with which the directors direct what , in other hands , would be over - the - top distractedness ( imagine , i suppose , robert rodriguez directing this . . . then again , after seeing the \" evil dead \" films , i \\' d hardly assume raimi would be able to pull something like this off , although there are moments of the film which are easily dubbed \" raimi \" moments , a rifle - shot notwithstanding ) . instead , raimi directs with maturity and a gentle touch , easily letting the story and characters co - exist , while still letting some of the more traditional raimi elements come out , like some offbeat comic touches . most particularly , billy bob thornton \\' s character , jacob , is a brilliant creation . his dim - wittedness is often hilarious ( for most of the film , every line he uttered was greeted with howling laughter ) , but there \\' s authenticity to the performance that strangely enough makes sure that we \\' re not totally laughing at him . the chuckles he gets are not necessarily ones of full - condescension because thornton is so damn real . jacob \\' s a multi - dimensional character , and while being stupid , we see that as not so much a flaw , but a strength to his character : his simplicity is endearing and many of the acts he commits are out of a strong inner strength and belief system , primarily towards the middle where his bud and co - conspirator begins to make some heavy waves concerning the money . the final third of the film spends much time with him , and many of the touches upon his character , not only by thornton but also by screenwriter scott b . smith ( adapting his own book , by the way ) are just great . i particularly admired a back story about an old high school girlfriend , told by thornton with such sincerity and acception that the cruel story is reversed to near - sweetness and further strength of his saddened character . thornton is absolutely brilliant in this performance , by far the best performance he \\' s ever given and further proof that he \\' s the best character actor in contemporary cinema ( if you don \\' t believe me , go back and watch his wonderful performance in \" primary colors , \" a performance that would have been nominated for an oscar if this hadn \\' t been in the same year ) because he \\' s easily able to slip into a character , and make him completely and utterly believable . he brings so much weight to the film that , as it is with most character actors , it \\' s difficult picturing anyone else in the role . the rest of the cast is great too , from paxton \\' s declining working man to chelcie ross \\' amiable town sheriff . even fonda shows off her talents nicely . and if i had any complaints about the film , it \\' s that the plot is almost too simplistic , and that at times , it seems too much like an exercise , like a cruel test on humanity that still pays attention to the humanity involved . and the occasional narration is , as it usually is , annoying ( narration should be used with extreme caution , especially when you \\' re trying to set things up and / or express emotions - didn \\' t raimi watch the first murder scene ? ) . and , the thing that can most usually go wrong with a movie , the ending is basically amiss . i won \\' t reveal it , but it \\' s way too cruel and too much of an outsider set - up , as if the appearance of a plane wasn \\' t already too much of that anyway . for a film that deals so much and so intimately with the humanity of the characters involved , this is the wrong ending . imagine a character - controlled ending ; otherwise , it \\' s like if in \" crime and punishment \" if the police had caught him instead of him breaking down and confessing . . . not that i \\' m at all comparing \" a simple plan \" to dostoevsky . the ending does work , despite my protestations , but to me , there was something incessantly nagging and unsatisfying about it ; but if you had no qualms and were happy as a clam with it , then just ignore me and go about your day . but despite my mere claims , make no mistake that i was completely and utterly edge of my seat throughout , and even sometimes curdling up by the situations that occured , not because of any kind of gore factor ( which is , thankfully for this , very minimal ) , but because the film places its characters in situations and gives them such painful things to overcome that i \\' ve frankly not seen much like it in quite awhile . at least not since the previous worthy hitchcockian masterpiece .',\n",

              " ('on re - watching italian writer / director dario argento \\' s much lauded murder mystery tenebrae , i was struck more than anything else by how many sins he commits as a storyteller and manages to get away with . in emphasising style over matters of plot argento is somewhat notorious in cult film circles , but some aficionados still praise tenebrae as the greatest of his \" giallo \" murder mysteries . while it \\' s certainly not perfect , repeated viewings reveal it to be nonetheless a densely plotted and terrifically stylish thriller . the story follows a promotional visit to rome by famous american mystery novelist peter neal ( anthony franciosa ) where he discovers that a serial killer is on the loose inspired by his latest book \" tenebrae \" . with the police on his back for leads , he decides to take a personal interest in the case and he soon becomes drawn into a mystery where all is not as it seems . the film benefits enormously from a fine central performance by franciosa . he brings grace , charm and a deceptive benigness to his character which provides an interesting foil to both the violence of the books he writes and the unfolding real - life horror around him . the film is awash with a fascinating psychosexual tension . argento peels back the facade of showbiz and jetset lifestyles to reveal an amoral , ambivalent , shadowy world where desire in all its forms has become a dangerous business . tenebrae is perhaps the most multi - layered of argento \\' s scripts to date and there is much bubbling underneath the surface here . it may take at least two or three viewings to appreciate all the psychological themes at play . in that respect it strongly recalls his previous giallo deep red / profondo rosso ( the full - length italian language version ) and fans will enjoy spotting the recurring themes . needless to say for argento fans , there is no denying the director \\' s brilliance as a stylist . many of the action and murder sequences are directed with his characteristic finesse and feature plenty of intriguing camerawork . they are all the more impressive for the fact that in this film argento creates mood by filling his scenes with light , rather than the dark shadows and deep rich colours of earlier works like deep red and suspiria . instead , tenebrae \\' s set design and lighting paints a sleek , clinical , chilly vision of a vaguely futuristic urban world . and the soundtrack \\' s mix of electronic atmospheres and gothic rock by frequent argento collaborators goblin is the perfect accompaniment . so tenebrae has much to recommend it , no question . still , constantly nagging at the back of this viewers mind is several lumps in the narrative . some critics argue that logic doesn \\' t matter in argento films , but damnit , it matters in all films to the point where viewers don \\' t deserve to feel cheated . by the way , if you don \\' t want to know the solution to the mystery then skip the next three paragraphs . about an hour into tenebrae the story takes an unexpected twist which , properly handled , could have proved ingenious . we witness the murder of the serial killer himself by a man who , we later discover , is none other than the author peter neal . he is insane , apparently . the murders then continue for the remainder of the film as neal decides it \\' s time to settle some personal business involving his neurotic wife . he is finally revealed to us as this \" second killer \" in the film \\' s bloody climax . but argento muffs the twist , both technically and narratively . you see , we are supposed to be tricked into thinking that during this scene peter neal is actually an innocent witness who was crouching in the bushes nearby the whole time and spying on the killer \\' s house . but thanks to poor editing , its had to believe neal could have murdered the killer anyway . bad cutting puts the timing way out . in other words , he \\' s almost in two places at once . during this crucial scene we are also thrown a ridiculous red herring . by the film \\' s end you realise that for the sake of an alibi neal must have self - inflicted a nasty injury in this earlier scene to make it look like he was attacked by a fleeing assailant . the injury ? he banged himself on the head with a bloody great rock ! thus , the revelation of the \" hero \" as a killer ( and anti - hero ) in the final scenes may still prove shocking , but its all somewhat implausible by the time the end credits have rolled . helpfully , in the end we do learn that the bizarre flashbacks of personal humiliation and murder that have permeated the film belonged to neal all along . but there too is a problem , as the explanations offered for his motivations are psychologically fuzzy to say the least . the story owes us a better understanding of franciosa \\' s mind , his concealed madness and his sudden murderous rampage . tenebrae is also marred by annoying little inconsistencies . for instance , a teenage boy and girl leave a hotel room and minutes later we see the girl riding off on the back of a motorbike . we would assume the rider is the same boy , but it turns out to be some male character we aren \\' t even introduced too ! that \\' s careless filmmaking , pure and simple . why , you may ask , do i go on about the story \\' s flaws ? because when it comes to visuals and set pieces , argento is one of the most exciting filmmakers in the world . take one of the extended scenes in tenebrae . an upset girl wandering the streets at night needlessly taunts a guard dog to the point where - almost unbelievably - it jumps a high fence and chases her across town . finally , as she desperately seeks escape from this crazed canine , she accidentally stumbles on the serial killer \\' s lair . it \\' s an absolutely masterful sequence , tense and exciting , and communicating a wealth of information through visuals alone . and that \\' s exactly the kind of thing that makes the flaws so frustrating . too often , it seems , argento \\' s films as a whole are less than the sum of their impressive parts . mind you , if you love murder mysteries then tenebrae is still worth a look . and if you \\' re a fan of argento \\' s unique style of giallo thriller then it \\' s essential . see the uncut widescreen version if you can and drink in some of the wonderful cinematography by luciano tovoli . it \\' s a stylish , great - looking and quirky film despite the problem narrative . a shame , because it doesn \\' t have to be that way . take argento \\' s more recent stendhal syndrome ( 1992 ) , where with the aid of co - writer franco ferrini he fashioned a solid storyline without sacrificing any of his surreal weirdness or visual panache . proof that he can do it , if he tries . . .',\n",

              " ('martin scorsese \\' s films used to intimidate me . because of his reputation , i felt obligated to appreciate them as deep film art rather than as great flicks . as much as i enjoyed them , i usually felt like i missed something . i learned from scorsese \\' s casino that whatever techniques he uses are merely there to enhance the story . no mystical interpretation is required to appreciate his movies . for example , in casino he uses subtitles when robert deniro and joe pesci are using code words with each other . there was no meaning more exotic than that subtitles were the most succinct way for him to tell the audience what was really going on . or toward the end , when he uses three quick dissolves to compress a scene of a car backing away from a building . again , the simple , mundane explanation is that it helped the pacing . i don \\' t mean to say that his techniques are not creative or good - looking . but he simply uses the best tool for the job . it shouldn \\' t have surprised me , then , that kundun , a film about a mystical religion , actually turned out to be quite straightforward . the movie follows the life of the 14th dalai lama , the spiritual and political leader of tibet . the movie \\' s title is another name for the dalai lama which means \" ocean of wisdom . \" his story is told in strict chronological order and there are only a few cinematic visions to embellish the literal story . ( one of which makes an interesting statement : pay attention to the film \\' s opening shot and watch where it is repeated . ) we first glimpse the dalai lama when he is two years old . his curiosity and self - assuredness capture the attention of a monk wandering in search of the new lama . a test is arranged to see if this boy really is the reincarnation of the 13 dalai lamas who have gone before . several items belonging to the previous dalai lama are laid before the boy alongside some other items . the child is asked if he recognizes any of the items as his own . the boy picks correctly , proving that he is the new , and the old , dalai lama . scorsese and long - time editor thelma schoonmaker were kind enough to allow the possibility that the child was taking his cues from the monk . before selecting an item , he would look at the monk , perhaps for some sort of confirmation . sometimes he picked right the first time , and sometimes he made a second choice . either way , whether through reincarnation or quick human perception , the tibetans were assured of choosing a boy who could be a wise , perceptive leader . > from this point on , the boy is raised as the reincarnation of the lama \\' s spirit and the future leader of a nation . it is a great weight to put on the mind of a child . in the u . s . it might be grounds for a call to social services . but the young lama accepts his destiny without any apparent emotional damage . neither the great power nor the awesome responsibility keeps him from becoming a genuinely likeable , well - rounded person . certain patterns take shape over the years . for example , the dalai lama is fascinated by technology . radios , clocks , and telescopes are some of his favorite toys . when he is old enough to accept his leadership , he makes plans to modernize isolated tibet . he also has a soft spot for creatures who are suffering or in pain , including herd animals . it \\' s nearly a running gag that he will buy sheep to keep them from being herded to slaughter . but the most ominous constant throughout his life is the presence and threat of tibet \\' s gigantic neighbor , china . tibet and its leaders prove correct in fearing china , as , first the propaganda , then the political pressure , and finally the armies , come across their common border . the chinese invasion is so successful that the lama \\' s life is in danger if he stays . the movie ends when , after much agonizing , the dalai lama leaves tibet for india . the story doesn \\' t lead up to a cinematic climax as strongly as most feature films do . it just doesn \\' t fit that mold . if it were forced into such a shape it would have been a completely different movie ( perhaps more like seven years in tibet , which is good in its own right ) . the pacing of kundun is more calm and level than that . the structure of the film is made to fit the characters and events , not vice - versa . perhaps because the pace is slower , we have more time to notice the beautiful art , vestments , and architecture of tibet . a mandala , ( tibetan sand painting ) with beautiful , vibrant colors is shown throughout the movie . the robes and hats of state are bright red and gold . the bricks are a rich reddish brown , not unlike the skin tone of the tibetans . even the touchstone pictures logo before the movie ( which is usually light blue ) is the red and gold of tibet . philip glass composed the music for kundun , and he was the perfect choice . for those who don \\' t know of glass , his music is like a tibetan mandala . his building blocks are lots of small notes , tiny grains of music , which are first grouped , then repeated in patterns . these patterns create interesting textures which are themselves part of a larger composition . people won \\' t be flocking to kundun for it \\' s great ending , or talking about its outstanding plot , but it does have a lot to offer : an interesting lifetime , exotic sights , rich cinematography , and innovative music . it gives interesting insight into tibetan buddhism and takes a warm look at the dalai lama as a person . on top of it all is the cinematic mastery of martin scorsese , who gives the film a strong , beautiful , consistent look .',\n",

              " (\"getting it right is a far far cry from the teenage sex comedy you might expect from a summer movie about male virginity . the film was directed by randal kleiser , who brought us such bubble - gum classics as grease and the blue lagoon . but thanks to kleiser ' s surprisingly good direction and an intelligent script , getting it right is a pleasantly quiet , moving , and memorable film -- one geared strictly toward a sophisticated , adult audience . getting it right stars jesse birdsall ( emily lloyd ' s boyfriend in wish you were here ) as gavin , a painfully shy 31 - year - old hairdresser who lives at home with his parents and who -- gasp -- is still a virgin . gavin has no problem whatsoever making small talk with the elderly women who clamor for his services at the hair salon , but expose him to a single 30 - year - old beauty and he ' s a mess . much to gavin ' s surprise , the woman who finally brings him out of his shell and robs him of his virginity is joan ( lynn redgrave ) , a rich , married , and lonely 45 - year - old . getting it right is the simple story of gavin ' s awkward and haphazard efforts to get it right ; that is , to find the right woman to fulfill his life . getting it right is one of those rare movies that devotes itself entirely to in - depth character development . gavin ' s self - conscious voice - over narration of his experiences firmly thrusts us into his psyche . we observe his fascinating metamorphosis from shy and passive introversion to assertive and self - confident maturity . birdsall ' s superb , understated performance as gavin is the real backbone of the film ; he seems convincing and authentic throughout . the charm of getting it right also lies in the wide array of people who inhabit or invade gavin ' s life . despite her limited screen time , redgrave makes quite a splash in the movie as gavin ' s middle - aged seducer . for a supporting character , joan is unusually and impressively complex , thanks in large part to redgrave ' s magnificent performance . gavin is also pursued , or perhaps plagued , by minnie , the totally neurotic daughter of a rich aristocrat . after minnie and gavin meet at a party , she takes great pleasure in disrupting his safe and simple life . helena bonham carter is delightfully pathetic and kooky in the role , and sir john gielgud , with his tongue in his cheek , embodies the height of arrogance as her father . gavin ' s eventual love - interest is jenny , the adorable twenty - year - old single mother who assists him at the beauty salon ; london stage actress jane horrocks ' fine performance yields a touchingly sweet character . peter cook , the great british satirist , appears briefly in the film as gavin ' s uptight employer . the scenes of gavin ' s home life with his parents are also a treat . gavin ' s over - protective mother ( pat heywood ) , whom even woody allen would find overbearing , almost steals the movie . her life seems limited to just two activities : treating gavin like a 10 - year - old and preparing exotic but inedible meals , such as scalding hot curry and baked chicken with chocolate sauce . gavin and his father ' s attempts to avoid eating her meals are extremely amusing . getting it right , for the most part , is very well - crafted , except for two minor shortcomings . first , the movie is about 15 minutes too long , and consequently it loses momentum at times . second , the film includes an altogether extraneous subplot about the domestic problems between gavin ' s best friend , harry , and his unfaithful lover , winthrop . overall , however , getting it right is quite memorable for its humor , depth , sophistication , and outstanding acting . director kleiser and screenwriter elizabeth jane howard ( adapting her own highly acclaimed novel ) deserve praise for finding just the right tone for this tale of growth , maturation , and self - discovery .\",\n",

              " ('with many big - budget science fiction films , great ideas are often wasted by bad scripts , cheesy plot twists , and , terrible acting . the fifth element , the abyss , and godzilla had great concepts squandered by bad acting , writing , or both . at first glance , the matrix , larry & andy wachowski \\' s sci - fi / kung - fu / shoot - em - up spectacular , looks like a prime candidate to join the list of high - concept bad movies , especially with dopey keanu reeves in the leading role . but despite high levels of cheese and gaudy dialogue , the matrix works . it \\' s an uncanny blend of action and surreal fantasy that borrows from dozens of other films ( most obviously the terminator films , star wars , and total recall ) , but remains refreshingly original and interesting throughout . reeves plays neo , a computer hacker who stumbles into an initially bewildering set of encounters with \" trinity \" ( carrie - anne moss ) , a rival hacker who has supernatural powers and stunning good looks , a unseen , omniscient cult figure known as \" morpheus \" ( lawrence fishburne ) , and a trio of creepy men in dark suits who act like irs agents from hell . neo quickly learns that the world he has known all his life is not what it seems . moreover , he discovers that the grim , bleak world he is introduced to has been waiting for him to save it . neo is reluctant to assume the role of messiah , with grave doubts that he is actually \" the one \" prophesized to come and save the world . reluctant or not , what follows is a mix of hong kong - style slow - motion shootouts , surreal dream sequences , high speed chases , and comic book kung - fu fights . the film also raises interesting philosophical questions about reality . how exactly do you know what is real and what is in your mind ? and if the real world were much harsher and grim than a fantasy one you were living in , would you want to face the true world or continue to live in a more comfortable illusion ? unfortunately , the matrix doesn \\' t provide many answers to the questions it raises , but at least it puts some ideas behind all the explosions , shoot - outs , and flying roundhouse kicks . perhaps stealing the entire show in the matrix is australian actor hugo weaving , who plays agent smith , the leader of the creepy agents in sunglasses and suits who seem capable of being anywhere and doing anything to stop neo and friends from destabilizing the matrix . weaving \\' s stony appearance , deadpan voice , and chilling comments put a grim human face on the haunting , evil technological force that controls the matrix . like robert patrick as the shapeshifting t - 1000 terminator in terminator 2 : judgement day , weaving is more frightening than any monstrous alien or homicidal robot because , despite his power and seeming invincibility , he looks ordinary , even scrawny . weaving embodies his role with a memorably chilling presence . the film features some truly breathtaking special effects and stylish cinematography . it seems to be deliberately kitchy , with stylized fight sequences directed by hong kong stunt specialist wo ping that reportedly required months of martial arts training by the actors . in a few scenes , the posing and posturing is unintentionally funny . just seeing keanu reeves engaging in serious kung fu is a bit jarring . however , with the comic - book style and tone of the film , you can sustain willing disbelief long enough to enjoy the ride without losing patience . the matrix isn \\' t a classic . its open - ended and confusing conclusion raises more questions than it answers . it fails to resolve many of its own plot twists and philosophical questions . it also relies on some conventional sentimentality to save the hero - the kind of shmaltzy feel - good goo that most of the film avoids . reportedly , the producers have high hopes for the film being the first in a trilogy and have already begun work on the story for the sequel . unfortunately , audiences deserve a little more than a vague sense that the story will continue in the future . the matrix is an fun , enjoyable diversion , like a big puff of cotton candy at a carnival . just don \\' t be surprised half an hour later when you still feel a little hungry .',\n",

( think charlie and irene will fall in love ? yeah , me too . ) the farrellys then introduce scores of different characters , and none of them ever manage to do anything you haven \\' t already expected them to do , no matter how outrageous their actions might be . compared to the curveballs the farrellys are used to throwing , this stuff is almost entirely soft - tossed , presenting an obvious problem : when gross - out humor loses its shock value , it \\' s no longer funny , merely gross . the jokes that do work are milked over and over until their effectiveness runs dry . take , for example , the subplot involving charlie \\' s three black sons ( anthony anderson , mongo brownlee , jerod mixon ) . the incongruity of it all is funny for a while , with three burly black men discussing higher math in ghetto language and white - bread carrey mouthing said language with an entirely too - pleasant smile on his face . but by the end of the film , they \\' re still doing the same schitck ; it hasn \\' t been elevated to another , funnier level , and it hasn \\' t been dropped either . that \\' s too bad , because it ceases to be amusing about halfway through . \" me , myself & irene \" reeks of wasted opportunities . there ought to be more focus on how other people react to charlie \\' s new personality , and on how charlie deals with the consequences of hank \\' s actions . this doesn \\' t really happen ; nearly every supporting character learns about charlie \\' s condition early on , so they don \\' t have any opportunity to be surprised by it . the film throws what looks like a patented farrelly curve in a scene towards the midway point ( involving an albino companion charlie and irene pick up called , appropriately , \" whitey \" ) , but the script doesn \\' t go anywhere with it , instead leaving the thread twisting in the wind before awkwardly tying it up during the climax . jim carrey is a gifted comedian , both physically and vocally , but he \\' s left with nothing much to do here except contort himself in a manner similar to steve martin in \" all of me . \" it \\' s a great showcase of flexibility and split - second role - shifting , but none of it is terribly funny . carrey doesn \\' t pull any stunts we don \\' t expect him to pull , and the farrellys \\' script doesn \\' t give him anything else to pull : the situations in which he must perform the role - shifting aren \\' t set up in any meaningful way . perhaps carrey can take solace in the fact that his supporting actors fare no better . zellweger \\' s irene is not a strong female lead ; mary in \" mary \" may have been part adolescent fantasy , but she was also intelligent and strong - willed . irene is nothing in particular , as the film never makes clear whether she \\' s ditzy , clever , or neither . as such , she gives us nothing to latch onto as the only \" sane \" person in the film . chris cooper is stuck playing exactly one note as a corrupt fbi agent , and his character is entirely too straight - laced for a movie like this . he , like the others , does absolutely nothing unexpected . after viewing the shapeless mess that \" me , myself & irene \" eventually dissolved into , i was stuck wondering whether or not the farrellys had outsmarted themselves . maybe their kind of comedy can only work for so long until audiences get wise to it and stop being shocked . but i don \\' t believe it -- good filmmakers find ways of surprising their audiences even after people have grown attuned to their style . if the farrellys are indeed good , smart filmmakers ( and i still think they are ) , they \\' ll rebound just fine . even after that happens , though , i \\' ll still consider \" me , myself & irene \" to be a high - caliber misfire .',\n",

              " ('there is a scene in patch adams in which patch is in the center of a courtroom , surrounded by people who are giving him a lively standing ovation because of his strong - worded attack on a group of stoic doctors . when i noticed that the audience with whom i saw this film was reacting the same way , i realized that i was going to have a hard time finding someone who agrees with me about the quality of the picture . you see , patch adams revolted me beyond all boundaries . i hated this movie for every second that i sat watching it , and i actively hate it now , days later , with the simpering , superficial , nauseatingly sentimental images forever plaguing my memories . i hate every element of the film , beginning with tom shadyac \\' s shameless direction , and all the way up to the misguided and mishandled themes that the screenplay wants so desperately to convey . the badness of patch adams is stupefying . it \\' s confounding . i can \\' t believe a film can be this bad . and yet , it \\' s based on a real man who probably has a good point to make . in the film , patch is played by the undefeatable and indefatigable robin williams , in a performance of such insulting pathos and sledgehammer sympathy that i wonder now if he is even human . in the beginning of the film , patch commits himself to a mental institution because he doesn \\' t want to kill himself . while there , he notices that the doctors don \\' t care about the patients , and that the best way to get through to the patients is to treat them like human beings . so , patch goes on a crusade to be a great doctor who actually talks to his patients . he goes to medical school , where he meets truman ( daniel london ) and convinces him that it \\' s good to help people . he also meets carin fischer ( monica potters ) , the anti - male med student who just wants to go through the motions and be a successful doctor . naturally , the dean of the medical school ( bob gunton ) hates patch , and wants to thwart his plans , even though patch gets the highest scores on all of his exams . so patch decides that he \\' s going to build a free clinic in the middle of nowhere to help people with any problem they may have . and that , my friends , is the synopsis for what is easily the most abhorrent picture of 1998 . on a superficial level , the film is not particularly bad : i wouldn \\' t say the cinematography bothered me , and most of the performances seem to be exactly what shadyac was aiming for ( i actually liked potter \\' s performance , even if she is wasted ) . but the film fails fundamentally in execution . every scene swells with grand , \" emotional \" music , played at maximum volume just to get us all to cry real hard . take , for instance , the first scene , which shows patch sitting on a bus . we don \\' t know patch yet , but there \\' s sad music , and it \\' s supposed to make us really sad that he \\' s sad . later on , patch makes a lot of progress : he helps a dying patient ( peter coyote ) to enjoy the last days of his life , and the music as patch is pushing the patient recklessly through the halls of the hospital is very lively . and when that patient finally dies ( spoiler alert ! ) , the music is very very sad . but the problem with all of this is that the music should not be the center of the emotions . real drama is character - based . you grow to like someone , and then something bad happens , and you feel it . we don \\' t ever grow to know the dying patient ; he \\' s simply a vehicle for patch \\' s greatness . real drama doesn \\' t seem forced , or present just to make the audience cry . that \\' s why patch adams is not real drama . it goes for every cheap tear imaginable , wringing tired and overbearing sentimentality out of every scene . even scenes that have very little impact on the overall film are drowning in marc shaiman \\' s sickening musical score . sentimentality like this is indeed bad . but it \\' s not as bad as half - baked , simplistic themes . you see , patch is a really great student . he aces his tests without studying , and does it so effectively that people think he \\' s cheating . but patch doesn \\' t think that memorizing facts is the way to become a good doctor . \" why don \\' t we see patients until the third year ? \" he bursts out every three seconds . well , patch , that might have something to do with the fact that you need to learn something before you go treating patients . not everyone has the capability of memorizing facts with no effort . most of us have to study . and a doctor who really wants to help , but doesn \\' t know a toe from a finger , probably won \\' t be too successful in preventing death . oh wait , i almost forgot : the point of doctors is not just to \" prevent death , \" but to \" improve the quality of life ! \" yes ! that is true ! and you can not do that without studying . you can not do that without going to medical school . what patch never seemed to understand was the possibility that maybe , just maybe , it is a good idea to study first and talk to patients later . follow the rules ? bah ! who needs the rules ! only uptight doctors follow the rules . the real saviors are the ones running around the hospitals with big red spheres on their faces and sporting baggy yellow pants . and then there \\' s the free clinic issue , which i find shockingly , frighteningly idealistic . a free clinic . in the middle of the forest . where patients can be taken to be helped . for free . how will patients be transported to the free clinic ? will it have an emergency room ? or is it just for mental patients ? and who , may i ask , will pay for it ? the film does give some token attempts to question patch \\' s motives ( i think another character asks him how he \\' s going to pay for it , in addition to a little bit of meaningless blather about hmos and medical insurance ) , but they certainly don \\' t explore or challenge patch \\' s ideas to any meaningful extent . reader , please understand this : i am not making any kind of judgment on the real patch adams . i know nothing about him . if his beliefs mirror those of this film character , then i might like to have an intelligent discussion with him about them . but regardless of what the real patch adams believes , the themes put forth in this film are simplistic and phony . and in the last scene , the big , obligatory courtroom scene that forced my lunch halfway up my esophagus , patch does a lot of shouting . actually , robin williams does a lot of shouting . he shouts a lot about helping people , and a lot of people cry because they are moved by his words . i won \\' t tell you that you can \\' t be moved by his words , because i , too , was moved by his words . i was moved in such a profoundly negative way that i was reminded of how cheap and phony a cinematic experience can be . patch adams is the cheapest of them all .',\n",

' ) . some actual spark is generated by leslie bibb , who plays luke ' s longtime chum chloe , and manages to successfully pull off some convincing dramatics . it really boils down to the actors attempting to puncture the surrounding plastic bubble of absurdity that cages them from minute one . or maybe not minute one , thanks to a decent set - up from director rob cohen , who films early sequences with a sense of atmosphere and style . it makes you wonder why he didn ' t flee indefinitely from the project , because while enjoyable cheese like ` dragonheart ' and the moderate stallone thriller ` daylight ' aren ' t superior cinema , they belong on the afi top 100 list when compared to this degrading trash . aside from unintentionally humoring the audience , ` the skulls ' gets little accomplished . the thrills and action are lazy and mechanical . the story is stuffed with ridiculous , formulaic plotting that sheepishly overlooks the cool potential of a secret underground society flick . instead of gaining knowledge about the skulls as an organization , we are thrust into a lame video surveillance conspiracy that has developed barnacles from excessive usage . we ' ve seen it all before , and better . ` the skulls ' is a feeble little circus of stupidity , so miscalculated that -- while it would serve as a clever pun -- a term like ? boneheaded ' seems just too generous .\",\n",

              " (\"` run lola run ' , a german import that gained a stellar reputation at the sundance film festival , is a dazzling and kinetic film that deals with the subjects of fate and chance . for a berserk and retroactive 81 minutes of non - stop movement , we follow a fiery - haired heroine named lola ( franka potente ) as she sprints to save her boyfriend from the clutches of drug dealers . lola has roughly twenty minutes to somehow retrieve 100 , 000 marks in time to save manni ( moritz bleibtreu ) from being killed by the dealer . but , in something of a pseudo - ` groundhog day ' approach , director tom tykwer gives lola three separate chances to best navigate her way toward the goal . in these trio of episodes , we gradually learn the unique effects of fate , for even if tiny changes are made in lola ' s journey , the future can be seriously altered . ` run lola run ' is an experience like ` fight club ' or ` the matrix ' , in that each film takes you through a super - charged wormhole of bending reality in surreal and exciting ways . in addition , all three movies have a visual style that separates them from the rest of the pack . ` lola ' is no exception , with stylish quick - flash camera work and cinematography that serves as scintillating eye candy from the get - go . tykwer ' s world is a landscape of mood and color , with brilliant shades of red and pink ( including lola ' s fiery hair ) used as effective symbolism throughout . with it ' s visual style and mind - blowing pace , ` run lola run ' is one of the more invigorating movies of the year . even more so when considering the fact it ' s all stuffed rather nonchalantly into an 81 - minute time period . as a heroine , potente does little more than run wildly through the streets ( as the title suggests ) , but she has a certain flair and charisma . her exemplary running form made me wonder if she is actually a track star . meanwhile , bleibtreu does an equally fantastic job of bringing the dopey but passionate manni to life . both actors perform beyond the call of duty . the dazzling fun comes from predicting what each episode holds in store for lola , and the outcome is ultimately rewarding - several twists and turns are unique and unexpected . the other characters lola runs into ( both purposely and inadvertently ) include her banker father ( herbert kraup ) and a friendly security guard ( armin rohde ) , but aside from the two leads , no one has more than a few minutes of screen time . additional stars that couldn ' t possibly be ignored are cinematographer frank griebe and editor mathilde bonnefroy , who are both responsible for the film ' s eye - catching visual elegance . ` run lola run ' is subtitled , so be prepared to meet the challenge of reading the lightning - fast dialogue - occasional sections of it are especially fast . this is only one of the minor chores involved in watching . the other is the sense that we never get to really recognize who the real people are in this hyperactive situation . most are just chess pieces in tykwer ' s elaborate game of visual presentation , and he never really makes a significant move with any . but , the average viewer is likely to be so absorbed in the action that few will realize the lack of potency in a few elements of the screenplay . a few petty gripes aside , this film is a wild , exhilarating ride that turns maniacally on its wheel of originality . most people believe foreign films are mainly boring , talky character studies . perhaps ` run lola run ' will recharge their batteries . not only does this film offer insight into some intriguing questions of fate and destiny , it also delivers a white - knuckle visual rollercoaster ride of overwhelming audacity . like how the experience must have been for the persistent title character , ` run lola run ' is exhausting .\",\n",

              " (\"it was once said that in order to truly enjoy some of today \\x12 s movies or novels , you must \\x13 suspend disbelief . \\x14 however , there is a distinct separation between opening your mind to ridiculous situations and believing a bunch of flat lies . it came as no surprise to me to learn that huntingburg , indiana ( where the film is set ) , does not have a mcdonald ' s , a sears store , a statue of a man on a horse , nor even a dam close by . even if you can ignore these somewhat \\x13 white \\x14 lies ( even though the dam is crucial to hard rain \\x12 s plot ) ; there is still a bunch of things that just don \\x12 t gel . firstly , morgan freeman , possibly the greatest actor alive ( after such films as driving miss daisy , the shawshank redemption and se7en ) , was cast as a shifty goon intent on stealing enough money for a healthy retirement . he _should_ have played the town sheriff , an experienced and somewhat intriguing policeman . as a massive flood started by a dam accident overwhelms huntingburg , its residents presumably flee as the water level steadily increases . i say presumably simply because we never know what happened to them ; and it seems a tad strange that an entire town ( with the exception of some folk who get introduced along the way ) can vanish before the flood has actually started . but nether the less , armored guard couriers tom ( christian slater ) and his uncle are carrying three million dollars in the back of their van . with a heavy rainstorm causing depressing conditions and slippery roads , it doesn \\x12 t take long for the van to end up stuck amongst mud and water off the side of the road . jim ( morgan freeman ) and a small gang of thieves locate the van and attempt to steal the three million dollars . but of course tom is more than willing to save the day , so he takes the money and hides it elsewhere in town . the local sheriff ( randy quaid , whom most will remember as the drunken pilot in id4 ) and a couple of police men investigate the situation , but their morals are soon overpowered by greediness as each character contemplates what he / she would do with their share of the three million dollars . director mikael salomon has made sure that hard rain ends up turning everything topsy - turvy , and whilst the film may at first appear to be a definite \\x13 goodies versus baddies , \\x14 there are numerous twists in it \\x12 s plot that make this a slightly more enjoyable experience . but by the time these interesting changes occur , it \\x12 s far too late in the film for them to have much affect . hard rain \\x12 s continuos corniness and lack of originality washes out whatever hope the script may have had ; and although it \\x12 s cast is somewhat appealing most of its stars act well below par . not at one stage capturing what could have been a fabulous on screen battle between slater and freeman , we are left to reminisce on films that dared to do something different and achieved more than what was expected . such titles as broken arrow ( slater and john travolta ) and face / off ( nicholas cage and john travolta ) come to mind as films that have mastered silver screen confrontations . strangely enough , they were both directed by john woo and both star john travolta . we can forgive morgan freeman for giving a slightly disappointing performance since he is newish to the action genre , but christian slater could have achieved so much more had the amount of crummy one liners been reduced and some personality added to his character . if you had asked me whether slater could perform well enough to substantially boost a movie prior to the release of broken arrow , my answer would have been a definite no . i now know that he has no excuse , and _can_ do better ( if you don \\x12 t believe me rent a copy of broken arrow from your local video store ) . although hard rain never really works from the start , i somehow felt feelings of missed opportunity when the credits filled the screen . the addition of an enticing sub - plot would have given the film time to breathe , rather than try to cram 96 minutes of action and disaster into a story that can \\x12 t handle anything else . despite the fact that hard rain fails on almost every account , if your standards are low enough you may find this to be a mildly enjoyable film . no creative flair and no inventive scenes means that hard rain does not stand up well against its many competitors , but it doesn \\x12 t really matter since the last thing you would want to do after shelling about $ 8 . 50 is compare this to other films .\",\n",

yes and no . mainly yes , i \\' m happy to say . the first hour or so was beautifully done , not so much because of the scripting ( i \\' ll talk about that later ? ) but because the re - created ship and sets were stunning to look at , as was cameron \\' s directing , and the performances of the principal cast were so strong that the \" human \" aspect of the story , the romance between rose ( kate winslet ) and jack ( leonardo dicaprio ) , was enchanting . the film is told via flashback , with gloria stuart playing the elderly rose in the modern day ( you knew that , a \\' course ! : - ) ) . well , it \\' s an often effective device to use in storytelling -- though sometimes it can fall flat . does it work here ? in script form it doesn \\' t add all that much to the story . what does add a lot to the story is gloria stuart , whose stunning performance is the strongest , most moving of the film . her presence brings a much deeper level of passion , and depth to the story , and though her appearances are relatively brief , the film would have suffered without her . also impressive are dicaprio and winslet , who wholly succeed in rising above the often poor dialogue , and the bond they form is both heartfelt and moving . it \\' s an old story , you know -- forbidden love ala romeo and juliet -- but it works , and jack \\' s \" rescuing \" rose ( in both literal and figurative senses ) and teaching her to live life for what counts was pointed and touching . in fact , i enjoyed the first half of the film a lot , largely because winslet and dicaprio bring such and charm , energy to the romance . it \\' s engaging , touching and very enjoyable . there \\' s more than a tinge of poignancy to it as well , simply because you know it \\' s not going to be a happy ending . which leads us to the second half of the film . we all knew it was coming . i \\' m sure director cameron was looking forward with eager anticipation to it , because as he \\' s stated in interviews , the real thrust of the story ( for him ) was the sinking , and the jack / rose romance was a merely a manipulative plot device to get you emotionally into the film . i think that understates the importance of the romance , as i found it far more enjoyable than an hour of watching people die . the iceberg arrives , and the captain announces that titanic will have sunk in about an hour . and it is an hour . my goodness , we don \\' t miss a second of that hour ? gratuitous ? well , perhaps not by today \\' s standards , i \\' m sure there \\' s been far worse produced under the banner of \" entertainment \" in other films . but i certainly wasn \\' t prepared for how shocking and graphic the last hour or so would be . not that i \\' d expect the word \" understatement \" to be part of cameron \\' s vocabulary ( he who brought us such , umm , vivid films as \" terminator 2 \" and \" aliens \" ) . is it overdone ? i thought so . understatement can sometimes work wonders in conveying tragedy . no , no one expected a happy ending , but i didn \\' t quite expect the horrendously shocking and powerful scenes we were bombarded throughout the film \\' s second half . still , whether it was overdone and heavy - handed or not , if it was the shock - factor cameron was after it worked , because i was shocked and moved , in fact i spent most of the last hour in tears ! you really couldn \\' t help but get emotionally involved , whether it was wishing someone would knock that dreadfully psychotic fiance of rose \\' s overboard or desperately hoping that rose would rescue jack , or that jack would rescue rose , or that they would both survive . perhaps the most harrowing scene was when the ship has sunk , and those that sunk along with the ship freeze to death on the water surface . the bit where rose lets go of jack \\' s hand , while promising she \\' ll never let go in her heart was particularly heart - wrenching , and the sight of rescue boats sailing amid the ocean of corpses was a pretty powerful image , to put no fine a point on it . i loved the ending , however , which was both moving and slightly uplifting following the horror of the past hour and a half . so , we \\' ve established that the film is powerful and moving , if the last hour was rather excessive . haven \\' t mentioned the script . plot - wise it \\' s ok , though the jack / rose relationship was beautifully developed , but i \\' ve a feeling that \\' s to the actors credit if anything . as for the dialogue ? well , titanic is set in 1912 . it \\' s a period drama . but i saw very little indication of period in so far as the dialogue is concerned . did they really use phrases like \" goddamn it ! \" back in the turn of the century ? i doubt it . would someone talk like this : \" do ya love the guy or what ? \" . i doubt it . is such dialogue as \" i saw the iceberg , and i see it in your eyes now \" not just a bit ? clumsy ? yes it is . a little more attention to dialogue would not have gone astray , and cameron himself is to blame ( he wrote the script ) . stick with directing , dude . but its more than redeemed by the acting , with dicaprio and winslet on fine form , ably supported by a strong cast . star of the show was gloria stuart , though -- why didn \\' t she win that oscar ? ! after all , they were throwing oscars at \" titanic \" left , right and centre , but gloria was perhaps the most deserving nominee . directing - wise cameron does a spectacular job . like i said , his vision was a bit excessive , but at least he directed it well . i haven \\' t even mentioned james horner \\' s beautiful score . utterly heavenly , though when your dad and sister play the soundtrack a lot you do start to get a bit bored with it ! ; - ) i \\' ve finished my rant , which lasted a lot longer than i thought it would ! just leaves a couple of questions ; was it worth all those oscars ? hell , don \\' t talk to me about oscars . bloomin \\' farce . it was deserving in a number of departments , though . last question ; is it , as some suggest , one of the best films of all - time ? nope , i don \\' t think so . it \\' s certainly one of the most powerful and memorable films i \\' ve ever seen , but i don \\' t think it quite ranks as one of my all - time favourites . and as for the fact they \\' re reportedly making a \" titanic 2 \" ? well i guess that \\' s typical hollywood for you !',\n",

it is , though this plot , anything but unique and groundbreaking , is undermined by the film \\' s constant barrage of humor . when going after data , for instance , picard sings an opera piece with him ( this is supposed to be cute and humorous ) . in a much more funny sequence , work grows a large pimple on the side of his nose as a result of his exposure to the ba \\' ku homeworld , a pimple which his crewmates , try as they might , cannot avoid looking at . the acting in star trek : insurrection is , for the most part , pretty good . since they \\' ve been playing these characters for years , those portraying the enterprise crew reassume their roles effortlessly enough . the terrific actor patrick stewart plays captain jean - luc picard and delivers a moral speech , picard \\' s trademark , with his usual aplomb . brent spiner , another fine actor , plays the android data well enough again and provides the best moments of comic relief in the film ( though the old android - wishing - to - be - human motif will tire some trek fans familiar with the routine from the tv series ) . the supporting cast who appear in this movie alone are also pretty good . despite many other critics \\' negative opinions , f . murray abraham ( the winner of an academy award for his performance in amadeus ) plays the major villain ru \\' afro well enough . ru \\' afro reminds me , somewhat , of the baron harkonnen in the 1984 film version of dune . like the baron , ru \\' afro continuously has his skin looked after : it is stretched and stapled by servants . in one particularly memorable scene , ru \\' afro becomes very agitated , and his facial skin splits open and bleeds . ru \\' afro is no khan from star trek ii -- the best trek villain ever -- but he is much better than the forgettable dr . soran from star trek : generations . ( okay , i promise , no more comparisons . ) donna murphy must also be noted as a ba \\' ku woman , anij , who picard falls in love with . murphy is not a young woman with a supermodel body ; she is a mature woman with an attractive countenance . this is the type of woman whom picard , for those who know the character well , would be enchanted with . in fact , the chemistry between murphy and stewart works very well here . a particular plot point involving anij \\' s ability to slow time down , an ability which she shares with picard , becomes one of the most intriguing parts of the movie . for as good as the actors and setting were , star trek : insurrection \\' s special effects were surprisingly disappointing . they proved adequate , sometimes barely , for a 1990s mainstream science fiction film , but they fell way short of the standard trek movie and paled in comparison to those seen in the trailer for star wars : the phantom menace ( a trailer which reportedly preceded many showings of insurrection ) . the space battles involving the enterprise and sona ships , in particular , seemed trite and unsuspenseful , and the final confrontation between picard and ru \\' afro took place on a completely unconvincing interior of a satellite . the new enterprise itself , only seen in this film and its predecessor , remains largely unexplored , though its exterior doesn \\' t look quite right for a reason i cannot explain . despite star trek : insurrection \\' s frequent comic goofiness and occasional substandard special effects , i enjoyed the film . it maintains roddenberry \\' s largely optimistic view of the future and rejects the gritty violence of its predecessors , particularly star trek : first contact ( though , don \\' t get me wrong , the dark tones of trek films like first contact can work very successfully ) . i \\' d recommend insurrection as a matinee film for a saturday afternoon , especially for fans of trek or science fiction in general . rated pg , i can \\' t see this film being objectionable to the viewing audience , young or old .',\n",

              " ('\" mercury rising \" has numerous flaws , but there is one that really stands out : its central plot device is unnecessary . that \\' s right . the major aspect of the film , that which is supposed to make it different from other routine government conspiracy / action flicks could be dropped from the beginning , and the movie would turn out exactly the same , if not better . this central device is the fact that a nine - year - old boy is autistic . his name is simon , and an evil government bureaucrat named nicholas kudrow ( alec baldwin ) wants him dead because he unknowingly cracked a supersecret government code slipped into the back of a puzzle magazine by its programmers just to see if someone could beat it . simon is intended to be the heart and soul of the film , and we are supposed to feel for him because he is a poor handicapped child thrown into a violent , unfair world against his will , with only a renegade fbi agent played by bruce willis to protect him . the fact that he is autistic does nothing for the emotional intensity or the plot necessities of \" mercury rising . \" i suppose the original novel upon which the movie was based did much more with this aspect of simon \\' s character and his relationship with willis , but here it is lost . miko hughes , the young actor who plays simon , goes through the prescribed motions of being autistic : he walks slowly , drawls his words , kicks and screams when he \\' s touched , and has a hard time looking at other people . it \\' s a difficult role for an adult , much less a young child , to play , and unfortunately hughes never convinces us that he isn \\' t playing like he \\' s autistic . unlike dustin hoffman \\' s performance in \" rain man \" or leonardo dicaprio \\' s in \" what \\' s eating gilbert grape , \" we are always painfully aware that hughes is acting . however , unlike \" rain man \" which used its character \\' s autism in unique and interesting ways to build a credible and touching story , \" mercury rising \" could go right about its generic , predictable plot with simon being simply a really smart but really shy kid . hell , he doesn \\' t even have to be shy . in fact , the movie might have been more interesting if he had had a more active role , rather than just being carted around under willis \\' arm . willis \\' character , art jeffries , is a disillusioned fbi agent who has been removed from undercover work and is now doing menial tasks like listening to wiretaps with rookies who are happy to be doing anything . he becomes involved with simon when he is called to check out a murder scene at simon \\' s house , where his father has apparently shot his mother in the back and then committed suicide . of course , we know that isn \\' t the way it happened happen because we saw an evil , square - jawed government hitman with a mean - looking crew - cut knock off the parents . simon was able to get away , and jeffries finds him hiding in a secret compartment in a closet , which the rest of the chicago police department had overlooked . jeffries -- who is accused by several characters at different times of being paranoid although his actions never suggest it -- knows there is something more , and he makes it his personal mission to go against everything and everyone in order to protect simon . this is quite a task because that same hitman who knocked off simon \\' s parents is crawling everywhere , attempting to kill simon at the hospital , on the highway , and every other place he goes . late in the movie , jeffries is forced to enlist the aid of a pretty young woman named stacey ( kim dickens ) who he meets at a coffee shop . of all the hard - to - believe aspects of the movie , this is the worst . i can believe in the decency of the human heart , but stacey \\' s character is far too accommodating . not only does she agree to watch simon while jeffries runs off to solve the mystery , she lets him into her apartment at two o \\' clock in the morning when she knows the police is after him , and then lets him leave simon in her apartment which means that she has to forgo a business trip that is desperately needed to pay the rent . the grinding squeals of the rusty plot machine are almost overbearing at this point . the movie might have been redeemed by some good action sequences , but even here \" mercury rising \" doesn \\' t rise to the challenge . the movie was directed by harold becker , who has made some good suspense films including \" sea of love \" ( 1989 ) and \" malice \" ( 1993 ) , but his talent is nowhere to be found in this latest excursion . there is one fight on a streetcar between jeffries and another hitman ( played by peter stormare ) that is so ineptly directed , shot and edited , that i had no idea 1 ) exactly where they were on the streetcar , 2 ) who was hitting who , and 3 ) where this hitman came from and how he knew where jeffries and simon were . the grand finale takes place on the roof of a tall building , and features a harrowing ( yawn ) scene where simon walks along the very edge of the building , not because he has to , but because it \\' s more suspenseful that way . taken as a whole , \" mercury rising \" is an tepid , confused movie that lacks style , wit , and any traces of a sense of humor . usually willis brings his personal brand of understated humor to his roles , but here he is too straight and serious . this is because the movie wants to be an action flick and a heartfelt drama at the same time , but it ends up failing on both fronts . maybe the book was better , but the way it \\' s handled here is a perfect case study in formula filmmaking guaranteed to bore .',\n",

( jessica biel ) -- is so far out of his league that he probably shouldn \\' t even bother . . . but of course he makes a play for her . summer catch also makes an abortive stab at another half a dozen subplots -- the jealousy of fellow townie and brazen slut dee dee ( brittany murphy ) , the alienation felt by ryan \\' s non - baseball playing best friend ( gabriel mann ) , or the fat chick fetish of fellow player miles ( marc blucas ) . worst of these is a ludicrous bit involving that \\' 70s show \\' s wilmer valderrama and beverly d \\' angelo , both of whom appear in the film simply to provide a nutty mrs . robinson - like substory and to remind you of how much better done that was in bull durham . in fact , virtually all of summer catch feels like it \\' s been done better somewhere else . for starters , the film has a major question of identity . it \\' s definitely not a sports movie , and it fails pretty miserably at being a romance . the worst part is the amateurish script ( co - written by an arli $$ writing alumnus and a guy that starred in leprechaun 3 ) , chock - full of phony emotion . by the end , it all becomes a platform for each character to deliver a soliloquy to ryan that he must take to heart . dad is on hand to give fatherly yet drunken advice . coach ( brian dennehy , just loving the fact that he \\' s got some work on the big screen ) is on hand to give the curmudgeonly counterpoint . ryan \\' s catcher ( matthew lillard , playing himself again ) is on hand to tell ryan to \" play catch \" with him and make fun of the fat fetish guy . ryan \\' s stoner best friend is on hand to give the go - get -\\' em - tiger - we \\' re - behind - you talk . and the girlfriend is on hand to give heartwarming - nuzzly - follow - your - dreams counsel . before long , you start to wonder : is freddy prinze jr . is capable of having a thought of his own ? don \\' t answer that . the only real joy in the film is found in biel \\' s character , and not just because of the skimpy outfits , which are also usually wet . she \\' s the only one in the movie that is able to do much with her role , taking the rebelling - against - daddy character to at least a passing grade . when she \\' s on screen , the time flies by . when she \\' s not , you realize that for some ungodly reason this movie is almost two hours long . for a pg - 13 teen romance ( despite near - constant sexual innuendo ) , one has to ask warner brothers : what were you thinking ? ? ? for her part , biel has fallen so far from her 7th heaven roots that she has almost become denise richards . hollywood is either about to eat her alive . . . or vice versa . either way , good luck , jessica . as for freddie , if he keeps pumping teen romances out at the rate of two a year , prinze \\' s next \" summer catch \" is liable to be a venereal disease .',\n",

              " ('there are times when the success of a particular film depends entirely on one actor \\' s effort . often a single performance can turn what might have been a rather mediocre movie into something worthwhile . when one of these comes along , i usually try to think about how many other people put work into the movie , that there is no way one person could possible carry the entire project on his shoulders . but sometimes there is simply no other explanation , and such is the case with \" the hurricane . \" this biopic about falsely convicted boxer rubin \" hurricane \" carter would normally be called \" norman jewison \\' s \\' the hurricane , \\' \" as per the tradition of referring to a film \" belonging \" to a director . but though he does decent work , jewison cannot claim ownership of \" the hurricane , \" because there is one reason this film works at all , and his name is denzel washington . washington plays carter , a boxer who in 1967 was convicted of a late - night shooting in a bar . jailed for 20 years , he maintained that he had never committed the crimes , but remained in jail after a second trial and countless appeals . the situation changed when a group of canadians moved to washington and worked on freeing carter . through the efforts of that group and carter \\' s lawyers , he was eventually freed when their case was heard in federal court and the judge ruled that rubin carter had been unfairly convicted . the film details carter \\' s childhood , which had him in and out of jail because of the efforts of a racist cop ( dan hedaya ) . when he finally got out of prison for good , carter became a rising star as a middleweight pro boxer , seemingly having his career on track , until the police framed him for multiple homicide . despite the efforts of political activists and celebrities , he remained imprisoned . flash forward to 1983 , when lesra ( vicellous reon shannon ) a young african - american boy , living with a group of canadian tutors , reads the book carter wrote while in prison . the book , entitled \" the sixteenth round , \" opens young lesra \\' s eyes to the injustice that was carter \\' s life , and he vows to help free the incarcerated boxer . lesra convinces his canadian friends ( deborah unger , liev schreiber , john hannah ) to work with him towards his goal . \" the hurricane \" leans on denzel washington . he must carry virtually every scene by sheer force of will , and he does so brilliantly . it \\' s probably accurate to say that washington does not embody rubin carter , because he plays a character far stronger and nobler than any real person could hope to be . it would perhaps be more accurate to say that washington embodies the character of rubin carter -- a fictional personality invented solely for the film . the actor \\' s work is masterful ; washington throws himself into every moment , refusing to keep the audience at arm \\' s length . we feel everything he feels : the humiliation of having to return to prison after fighting so hard to make something of his life , the pain of having to order his wife to give up the fight , and the utter despair he feels when coming to the conclusion that all hope is lost . washington \\' s is a performance of weight and emotional depth . he doesn \\' t merely play angry , happy , or sad ; he feels it at the deepest level . his work is masterful , and for half of this film i realized that the scene i was watching would not have been nearly as affecting as it was if it had been in the hands of another actor . norman jewison directs the film , doing a reasonably good job of pacing and shot selection . \" the hurricane \" moves quickly , with no scene drawn out much further than necessary and the narrative galloping along nicely . jewison handles his multiple flashbacks well ; the audience is always aware of just what the time and place of each scene is , and nothing is terribly confusing . his boxing scenes , constructed with clear inspiration from \" raging bull , \" get inside the action very well , and they are believable as real sports footage . jewison puts together a particularly nice scene by utilizing a pretty cool trick : carter is sent to solitary confinement for 90 days when he refuses to wear a prison uniform , and jewison , assisted by some wonderful acting from a game washington , shows how carter gradually starts to lose his mind during the constant solitude , and eventually we get three rubin carters arguing with each other in one cell . jewison \\' s best achievement in \" the hurricane \" is succeeding at showing how carter becomes an embittered man during his hard - knock life , and how he is able to break out of that bitterness and learn to trust people again . sadly , though , the film \\' s chief failures lie with the screenplay , as with most of the good - but - not - great efforts to round the pike this winter . there is much to interest a viewer in \" the hurricane , \" but it seems that every time the film gets a chance to take the most clich ? d route possible , it does . take a look at the supporting characters , for example , who are drawn up as either entirely good or entirely evil . carter and lesra ( played nicely by shannon , who deserves credit ) are the only real people here ; everyone else is a stereotype . the canadians are good . the cops are bad . the canadians spend most of their time dolefully grinning at each other in their lovey - dovey commune ( and it is a commune , despite the film \\' s failure to make that clear ) , while every racist cop ( especially dan hedaya \\' s ) melts in out of the shadows and glowers at every black person that enters the room . much of the dialogue comes off as rather hokey ( \" hate put me in prison . love \\' s gonna bust me out . \" ) , and the big courtroom climax during which everyone gets to make an impassioned speech could have been lifted from a made - for - tv lifetime special . it \\' s too bad . the cast is game , the director does his job , and the subject matter is interesting , but the script takes the safer , slightly more boring route far too often . i wanted a real reason for the cop to hold a grudge against carter other than \" he \\' s a racist pig . \" i wanted more evidence that these canadians are real people with faults and virtues instead of a bunch of saintly crusaders looking for justice . in short , i wanted to see the film through a less distorted lens . criticism has been levied against the liberties \" the hurricane \" takes with the truth of what really happened to carter , and much of it is deserved . for example , the film gives us a boxing scene showing carter pummeling defending champ joey giardello , only to be screwed by the judges , who ruled giardello the winner . most accounts of the fight , however , have carter losing fairly . furthermore , much of carter \\' s criminal past is conveniently left out of the film , and just why he was convicted again in his second trial is never really explained . of course , \" the hurricane \" works mainly as a fable , so digressions from the truth can be excused at least partially , but even dismissing such issues don \\' t remove one fact : \" the hurricane \" is a highly flawed film . only one actor could have made a schmaltzy , predictable picture like this work as well as it does , and it \\' s a good thing \" the hurricane \" has that actor . carter has been quoted as saying , \" denzel washington is making me look good , \" but he \\' s not the only one . washington makes this film look good . denzel washington \\' s \" the hurricane . \" sounds pretty good to me .',\n",

' then i realized he was , and i was watching it . in the final third , the film undergoes another transformation , this time to unbridled sentimentality . note : major plot points are revealed in this and the final paragraph . max went to america because sammy promised to reunited him with his childhood love , lillianna , who hasn ' t seen him since he was a normal - sized kid . her refusal to see max ( unbeknownst to him ) leads us to an awkward ` ends justify the means ' scene as sammy ' s wife serena , played nicely by kathleen quinlan , poses as lillianna . i found this scene offensive . not only did it rely on deception to induce warm , fuzzy feelings from the audience , it reduced max to someone we should pity and coddle , which i thought was quite undeserved . i think max could have handled the truth , gratuitous illness and all . late in the film we learn max , and in fact all giants , have a heart condition which shortens their lives considerably . this could be an enlightening revelation , but the film seemingly presents it only to justify sammy ' s transformation into a caring , sensitive guy -- and hey , a great dad and husband , too ! ` my giant ' suffers from a poorly constructed story line and undeveloped characters whose actions are determined by plot points rather than their own internal persuasions . a stronger story with more room for character growth might have been possible if the focus was on max ' s struggle to be accepted and cast in movies instead of sammy ' s struggles to get money and become a better person . in this scenario , max ' s illness could have been a integral part of the film not a story motivator . sentiment and emotion would have followed naturally . instead , we ' re apparently not supposed to like sammy until the end , but we ' re not allowed to focus on max . crystal and muresan give adequate and at times enjoyable performances , but in the end , ` my giant ' left me feeling like i ' d been fed gruel from a giant spoon .\",\n",

              " (\"not since 1996 ' s shine , which starred geoffrey rush as pianist david helfgott , has a movie so defiantly laid bare the lives of world - class musicians . in fact , if one were to watch these films together , it would almost certainly stand as a convincing argument that a life of music naturally leads to all varieties of social ills . yet hilary and jackie , the sophomore effort from director anand tucker , has something more to say -- it softly but strongly explores the complex relationships of sibling rivalry and love in a very compelling tale . emily watson and rachel griffiths are the leads in this tale , playing the sisters du pr ? . both musicians from childhood , hilary ( griffiths ) is renowned flutist while jacqueline ( watson ) is easily as skilled on the cello . the two comepete for and win many honors as children and as young women , both together and seperate . their careers as musicians surpass and then bow to one another ' s , and although their lives take very different paths -- hilary settles down to marriage and a family while rachel skips across the globe on a world concert tour -- they are bound together by their deep family love . the performances of watson and griffiths are excellent in style and substance . they contrast each other wonderfully , and while watson ' s portrayal of jackie du pr ? is at times eccentric and perhaps unsympathetic , both characters are charged with emotion . the frank cottrell boyce script , which is based on the book by hilary and piers du pr ? , brings a great deal of depth to these characters as well . the script is also to be commended for its well - polished dual nature . cottrell boyce adopts a style which one might expect to see in a mystery thriller ( which was in fact the case with david koepp and robert towne ' s script for mission : impossible ) and skillfully molds it to the story of two rising musicians on different courses to fame . the latter parts of his script are controversial to say the least , and the rather depressing ending takes the wind out of an envigorating story . some will leave this movie feeling disenfranchised . nevertheless , hilary and jackie is a movie that reaches an upper echelon of contemporary cinema through solid fundamentals and is a decent watch all around .\",\n",

              " (\"of the major horror sub - genres , vampire movies are easily the most adaptable . think about it . frankenstein movies haven ' t changed all that much because they still need that mad - scientist - in - bavarian - castle setting . if you made a frankenstein movie today , you ' d have to have the monster be a virus or something -- and outside of michael j . fox , there aren ' t any actors that could play a virus convincingly . movies about mummies would still have to be set in egypt . there ' s not much you can do with werewolves except take them to london or paris , unless you want to have a teenage werewolf or something . ( and there ' s that michael j . fox thing again . ) but you can have vampires do anything , and you can place them in any genre you want , just about . you can have traditional vampire movies ( bram stoker ' s dracula ) or have the anne rice version ( interview with the vampire ) , or play it for laughs ( vampire in brooklyn ) . you can put vampires in locales from sunny southern california ( the lost boys ) to squalid mexican dives ( from dusk till dawn ) to your local high school ( buffy , the vampire slayer ) . were it not redundant , you could have a movie about a law firm full of vampires . any day now , i expect we ' ll see a movie about a vampire third baseman who has to decide whether to play a day game in order to break the home run record . or , you can insert the vampire legend into a hong kong action movie -- and when you do that , you get blade . wesley snipes has the chow yun fat role in this movie -- the silent , expressionless hit man who destroys everything in his path . in this case , the everything happens to be vampires that explode into cgi shards instead of dead , bleeding corpses . snipes has less to say here than as the fugitive in u . s . marshals , but does a demonstrably better job here as a half - vampire wreaking vengeance on the bloodsuckers . blade is a silent , brooding presence , laying waste to vampires without a shred of remorse . he is as cold as his silver - bladed sword , as single minded as his garlic - filled bullets . yet , he ' s not without quirks : blade drives a battered muscle car and has to glean rolex watches from his vampire victims in order to stay solvent . like any good hong kong movie , blade is heavy on the chopsocky action . for some reason , blade spends a lot more time using his kung fu artistry than using the traditional anti - vampire weapons of garlic and silver . ( blade dismisses a man - portable arc lamp as being too heavy , although it looks to be a more efficient tool to dispatch vampires . ) unfortunately , the guiding hand of john woo is absent from this film , relegating blade to the status of the replacement killers , which it most strongly resembles . the replacement killers is the last movie i saw that i didn ' t review -- mostly because it made no impression on me , and i couldn ' t remember anything other than noise , violence , and the intensity of fat ' s performance . blade has a little more going for it , and has the vampire myth to draw from -- but other than that , it ' s the same kind of movie -- exciting , with well choreographed action scenes , but with no resonance . with a stronger villain ( stephen dorff is ( pardon the pun ) curiously bloodless as the head vampire , leaving us to wonder what denis leary might have done with the role ) , a wittier script , and a strong supporting cast , blade might have been able to rise beyond the level of commonplace summer entertainment . as it is , blade is an average action movie that serves to do nothing but remind us that the summer movies just keep getting dumber and the vampire movies just keep multiplying .\",\n",

              " (\"` we run tings . tings don ' t run we . ' - sound advice from capone ( paul campbell ) to his squaddie ( or partner ) , floyd ( winston bell ) . jamaican film , shot entirely on video , featuring a standard cop movie plot mixed with a dash of john woo - styled brotherhood morals ( and a little gunplay ) . capone , a tough as nails super cop , gets a transfer back to his hometown of kingston after successfully taking down some gangsters that have broken into his home ( while he was with his lady ) and killed his partner in front of him . when he arrives , he discovers that the ghetto where he grew up has gotten worse , thanks mainly to the crime boss wonie ( jamaican film veteran carl bradshaw ) , so named because his left hand has been amputated and replaced by a grasping hook ) . capone discovers that wonie has been smuggling guns inside shipments of charity supplies for the area churches and , much to his disappointment , also finds out his childhood friend ratty ( mark danvers ) has been helping him . torn between doing his job and protecting his best friend , capone must make some hard decisions in order to make things right again . directed deftly by first time jamaican filmmaker chris browne ( assistant director for such american films as how stella got her groove back and instinct ) , one hardly notices the film was shot on video after a while . shots are handled so efficiently that they quickly take on the nuances of the aforementioned john woo films , although the action isn ' t as hyperkinetic as most of woo ' s films are . the action scenes are handled with a kind of flair though , and eventually begin to take on a life of their own ( beyond the hong kong films that they are obviously patterned after ) . the make - up effects are particularly good in these scenes as well , with flawless squib work on display from the effects team . the cast is superb and listening to their dialogue , spoken with thick jamaican accents ( half of which have to be subtitled because of their extensive use of slang ) , just adds to the interest . paul campbell , as the ` loose cannon ' capone , essays his role perfectly , displaying the right amount of menace and compassion at the right times . mark danvers evokes sympathy as ratty , the part - time gun smuggler who is also trying to help the community by building football fields and organizing block parties to bring people together . unfortunately , carl bradshaw is given the least to do and his character as the crime boss seems ineffective ( largely because his underlings seem to run all over him ) , but then again , that could be the way his character was intended to be portrayed . the music in the film is composed of all reggae songs , and the soundtrack was produced by grammy award winning artists , sly and robbie ( who have worked with the likes of the rolling stones , maxi priest , bob dylan , james brown , grace jones , herbie hancock , bootsy collins , and carly simon among others ) . the end credit song , ` we run tings ' , by the group red dragon , is pretty decent and carries on the theme of the movie established early on by the quote that opens this review . oddly enough , desmond ballentine ( who plays the character deportee ) is well known as a pioneer in the realm of ` gangsta ' reggae as the performer ninjaman , and he doesn ' t contribute a single song to the film ( that i could see ) , which is virtually unheard of here in the us . at the time of this writing , third world cop has been put into limited theatrical release in the us , coming off of a six - month box - office breaking run in jamaica , where it holds the position as highest grossing film of all time ( bringing in $ 21 million in jamaica , which is roughly $ 500 , 000 us ) . palm pictures ( the company that released the offbeat , but entertaining six - string samurai ) is the company releasing the film and considering that their main focus is the dvd market , i can imagine that a disc will be available once the film has left theaters . chris blackwell , founder of palm pictures , was also involved in the production of another jamaican box - office smash in 1981 entitled countryman , so i ' d say he has a pretty good track record . overall , third world cop is a pretty entertaining homage to the films of john woo , ringo lam , tsui hark , and many other action films by directors from hong kong . if action films are your thing and you don ' t mind intermittent subtitles , then you can ' t go wrong with this film . the performances and the story are solid ( if only a little cliched ) and the action is tight . i ' m not sure what the other jamaican films released in that country are like , but apparently third world cop ' s honors are well deserved .\",\n",

the deliberate pace allows for craftsmanship of detail and story . we see a lot of blood , but it \\' s not especially violent . the suggestion of what happens is far more disgusting than anything actually shown -- like most of the violence in \" pulp fiction \" . \" se7en \" is gory , graphic , and disturbing , but all the gore is post - death . still , if you tend to get queasy , don \\' t eat food during this film . kevin spacey plays john doe , the avenging angel who claims that he \\' s the messenger who will right the wrongs with his teachings . like many crazy men , he has some fine ideas , but some sick ways of expressing himself . spacey doesn \\' t appear until the final 30 minutes and also doesn \\' t receive billing in the opening credits . however , it \\' s his appearance that turns this film upside down and for that he should have gotten an oscar nomination . a great villain manages to make you either root for him or feel compelled to listen to his ramblings regardless of whether you agree with him or not . this character is so well written that it \\' s hard to disagree when he says that what he is doing will be remembered by everyone . no serial killer has ever been so creative . \" se7en \" is blatantly unsubtle with its messages about the horrors of the world and it \\' s often a little too depressing . what it lacks in those areas , it makes up for with believable dialogue , top - notch screenwriting , unexpected twists , and realistic characters . the technical aspects of the film are unobtrusive . fincher uses lighting , music , and editing quite well , but his story is always the thrust of the film . fortunately , we don \\' t find out what happens to mills and somerset after the closing credits ( which are run backwards up the screen ! ) . it \\' s better to imagine what paths they will follow . this is not the kind of film you turn away from and quickly forget . it \\' s got a sinister message and john doe is right about one thing -- the evils of the world aren \\' t going to cure themselves . \" se7en \" raises some tough questions and it \\' s intelligent enough to allow its audience to answer many of those questions for themselves . useless trivia -- co - stars in 1995 \\' s \" se7en \" , brad pitt and kevin spacey also competed for the 1995 best supporting actor oscar -- pitt in \" 12 monkeys \" , spacey in \" the usual suspects \" ( for which he won ) .',\n",

( harrier snake ? ) not to mention instant digestion so they could go snarf countless other victims . the writers tried to throw in some sort of plot twist ( should i call it a plot knot because it made no sense ? ) in which the sick guy \\' s g - friend kisses the evil dude and suddenly everybody hates said evil dude and starts trying to kill him . that was about as clear and understandable as mission : impossible . ( if someone could explain that movie to me , i \\' d be most grateful ! all the old - guy double agents looked the same ! ! ) i wasn \\' t inspired by the acting , save for the evil dude . i can \\' t blame the actors , though . it \\' s not their fault they had a cruddy script to work with . this concludes rydain \\' s diatribe on a shameless exploitation ( and perpetuation ! ) of public fear of snakes . comments , flames , anyone ? - rydain the atomic cheese , fresh from chernobyl dairies !',\n",

( 2 ) murphy wastes the talents of his fine cast . richard pryor , redd foxx , michael lerner , and della reese face the impossible task of carving out credible characters from a script riddled with stereotypes . each of them shines occasionally , but basically what we have are good performers stuck in a bad vehicle . ( 3 ) the movie demeans women by depicting them solely as sexual objects and as pawns in power struggles between men . murphy has admitted in interviews that he is weary of women in his private life , which is really neither here nor there . but when murphy puts his bitter feelings on 3 , 000 movie screens across the country , it \\' s another matter altogether . you \\' re forced to swallow some pretty gruesome stuff . for instance , murphy punches della reese in the stomach . and he shoots jasmine guy in the head . this is a mean - spirited movie , folks ! lovely newcomer lela rochon gets off easy in her role as a common whore , but only because she doesn \\' t have any scenes with murphy . thank god : he might have run her over with a bulldozer . ( 4 ) murphy has written for himself perhaps his blandest role to date . the loveable eddie murphy charisma emerges only once or twice during the film . murphy would rather give his character a spiffy wardrobe than a spiffy personality . sometimes it seems as if murphy made harlem nights just so he could wear fancy suits and look debonair . ( 5 ) the plot is a shameless rip - off of the sting . if you \\' re going to make another sting movie , you \\' ve got to do something original . murphy \\' s tale of warring nightclub owners in harlem ( circa 1938 ) fails to add anything new to the formula . ( 6 ) to get laughs , murphy makes fun of stuttering . you know a comedy is digging deep when it resorts to ridiculing the handicapped . ( 7 ) murphy \\' s idea of drama is a scene in which his character apologizes for the first time in his life . for what ? for shooting reese \\' s little toe off ! needless to say , murphy shows little , if any , promise or imagination as a screenwriter . in all fairness , however , a few rays of sunshine do manage to break through the gloomy cloud surrounding the movie . danny aiello is fun to watch as a dirty cop on the take . aiello stands out in the large , ensemble cast : he obviously relishes the opportunity to play such a nasty character ( a racist detective with mob ties ) . aiello \\' s zesty performance gives harlem nights some much needed spice . another bright spot is arsenio hall , who has a hilarious , show - stopping cameo as a cry - baby gangster ; hall virtually steals the spotlight from murphy . in fact , hall \\' s ten minutes on screen are the funniest ten minutes in the movie . unfortunately , his character is completely irrelevant to the plot ; murphy should have given hall a much bigger role . of course , i \\' ve already mentioned that i didn \\' t care for murphy \\' s character , but i have to admit that i did love his neckties . they are simply spectacular -- almost worth the price of admission .',\n",

( even the star trek movies dropped the numbers from their titles after star trek vi . ) the makers of watchers reborn probably want to fool unsuspecting video rental customers into thinking this might be a good movie instead of a crappy fifth installment of a film series which should have died a long time ago . this really isn \\' t a good movie . have you ever rented a movie and recieved a sinking feeling about it when you watched the previews preceding the feature presentation ? well , any hope a viewer may have had , perhaps because he is a fan of novelist dean koontz or actor mark hamill , will be dashed by the time he \\' s seen the trailers tagged on before the beginning of watchers reborn . they \\' re awful . these commercials cover films like a strange stripper movie called shadow dancer , some weird crap about a dead indian , teens , and wolves , and an \" action \" movie called detonator starring scott baio . scott baio ! what idiot dreamed this movie up ?

the acting is monumentally bad ; and the style of film making resembles a home video . it is december 31 , 1981 and the big party is at monica ' s ( martha plimpton ) house . but no one has arrived yet . her 8 invited guests and several people that they have picked throughout the evening are wandering the streets of new york city in various groups . some of them know each other through their common bond of having slept with monica , and some are total strangers . but they all are to face their own personal neuroses before night ' s end . those who are invited are the ones that have the issues . it is up to those who aren ' t to help them come to terms . first there is eric ( brian mccardie ) who is a former boyfriend of monica ' s and is just getting over the heartbreak of their relationship terminating prematurely because of his sexual performance , or lack thereof . he is one of the most bland characters , in a film full of dullness , because he is so utterly predictable and stereotypical , a common trait of this poor production . bridget ( nicole parker ) and caitlyn ( angela featherstone ) who are both extremely sensuous young women looking for someone to handle their desires on new year ' s eve and tag along to the party with them . they stumble across a nameless bartender ( ben affleck ) who is the one truly perfect character in a film of imperfections . he is nether sexually deprived , nor uncertain about his future , as he is in law school . his lack of flaws is both boring , unrealistic and painful to watch . as bridget and caitlyn make passes at him you are neither entertained nor humored by the sub - standard comedy . moving on , there is val ( christina ricci ) and stephie , ( gabby hoffman ) 2 teenage girls with fake identification and very different thoughts . val is monica ' s cousin and a true fan of the new york scene . on the other hand , stephie is convinced that she is vulnerable to crime when the two venture out of their usual locations in search of the party that they just can ' t find . paradoxically , it is 2 punks that they meet at a bar ( actually they attempt to flee from their presence , but aren ' t successful ) who guide them through their fears and force a level of relaxation upon their warped minds . of all the insanely dull and uninteresting couples , only one approaches a level of decency in both acting and plot . wisely , the movie ' s creators have put heavy emphasis on lucy ( courtney love ) and kevin ( paul rudd ) who are best friends and share the common bond of being dateless . paul has just broken up with long time steady ellie ( janeane garofalo ) and is starting to come to terms with his loss when lucy informs him that ellie had been sleeping around during their relationship . however , the only complexity to these two characters is that they seem to want to be more than friends , and that is reiterated when they attempt sexual intercourse in a bathroom stall on more than one occasion during this strange evening . finally , there are the two worst performances and worst sub - plot of the film . jack ( jay mohr ) and cindy ( kate hudson ) have been going out for a short period of time and jack just learned that he took cindy ' s virginity the night before . while she attempts to play this down and be her usual self , he is a predictably self loathing male as he attempts to deal with a string of one night stands that includes the recently deflowered cindy . very often , when a film is as putrid as this production , there will at least be a decent quality of film making to reveal an occasional moment of glory . however , this film has neither the quality of cinematography nor the moments of glory to be highlighted . instead , what you get is a collection of rough and inconsistent cuts , bad continuity and inaccuracies . first , and most noticeable is that as the film goes from one subplot to another , there is no apparent order that it follows , and it is also weekened by unnecessarily edgy edits from scene to scene and shot to shot . at other times , objects seem to get up and move and hairstyles and costumes change from shot to shot . there are also at least 4 scenes in a taxi cab that go from start to finish . not in a single one of them does anybody pay the driver . and yet , no matter how miserable this film may be , and no matter how poor the acting is all around , there was a ray of a hope for these many bad plots . perhaps , if the makers had just decided to concentrate on one or two or , perhaps , even three , there might have been the time and opportunity for some character development , or quality acting , or even a decent plot payoff at the end . but it didn ' t happen that way . the cast of quality name actors was forced into roles that not even one of them could convert into a mediocre performance , and every story line crashed and burned quicker than it takes for the ball to drop at midnight .\",\n",

( term used as loosely as possible ) survival instincts and a good dose of common sense seems to suggest grabbing the shotgun , which our hero does , but only after contemplating it for about thirty seconds . even when he does grab it he seems unsure how to hold it , going so far as to actually wonder if he should place a finger near the trigger . mind you , i \\' ve never fired a shotgun in my life but believe you me that the bad guy would be missing most of his vital organs , be he stoned or not . some will argue that our hero does not have a killer instinct , the hell with that ! two fbi guys have just been shot in front me , along with one bad guy and the other looks like he might go ballistic at any second . solution ? boom ! i \\' ll take the time to feel sorry about it later thank you very much . another prime example of the idiot hero syndrome : our boy duchovny needs to reach his girl before something bad happens to her . he knows the head bad guy has her on the tenth floor of a building and that he might be running into a room full of people with itchy trigger fingers . he still has his shotgun , bring it along you say ? no thanks , i \\' ll just ditch it in the back of my car . and the real kicker is this : when he reaches the room and people start shooting at him he has the nerve to look surprised ! while we are on the subject of getting shot , why in hades were those fbi guys sitting with their backs to the door ? i \\' ve got no formal training but even i know you never sit with your back to the door . ask mr . wild bill , the first and only time he did not sit with his back to a wall cost him his life . this is the major problem with this movie , any mook could have thought of a hundred ways to make it better . is it so much to ask that hollywood actually put a little common sense into their characters ? for instance : our heroes hide at duchovny \\' s summer home , now the bad guys could come knocking at any moment . ok , this time our hero does get himself a gun and has it at his side most of the time . but see , our hero is a drug addict and guess what ? he chooses now to go clean and suffer through dt . oh sure , he \\' ll be really impressive when the bad guys come calling . going clean is really honorable of him , but i would have waited until i did not need to be conscious or being able to fire a gun . for an enjoyable performance by timothy hutton , plot holes the size of godzilla , getting our intelligence insulted and several \" oh come on ! \" moments .',\n",

              " (\"keep cool , a chinese film directed by semi - accomplished filmmaker yimou zhang , was one of the kickoff films for this year ' s hawaii international film festival . on the day it premiered , lines of eager moviegoers stretched around the block , some anticipants having queued up well in advance to get a good seat in the theater . they need not have wasted their time . the movie is billed as a comedy , but is surprisingly bereft of humor . there are noticeable attempts at laughs , but very few tries actually click . i wondered if there were jokes that i wasn ' t getting because i ' m not from china , but unfortunately my conclusion was that this lack of humor couldn ' t be attributed to the cultural barrier either . keep cool just isn ' t very funny . the prelude to the film was a visit by keep cool ' s producer who , with the help of an interpreter , regaled us of how in order to get the print to the festival in time , an assistant hand carried it on the plane from china to hawaii . although the print made it , the assistant ' s luggage was lost . too bad that story wasn ' t in the movie , because it got a big laugh . qu ying , the film ' s female lead , was also on hand to give a few comments . however , whereas the producer politely made regular pauses in his dialog so the interpreter could bring us up to speed , ms . ying saw fit to say everything she had to say in one , fast - paced , incredibly long tirade . it was dizzying ; good foreshadowing for the film . you see , keep cool is filmed almost totally with a camera handheld by a man with a bad case of the shakes . at least that ' s the way it seems , since the camera is constantly moving . cinema verite is one thing , but panning and shaking around until your audience has a headache is another . although some might consider it a form which helps give the viewer an idea of the anarchic state into which chinese youth is slowly growing , i found it thoroughly distracting , and after a while , quite annoying . headache , as i said . the film is about a young bookseller ( wen jiang ) who is after a young woman ( qu ying ) . they used to be romantically involved , but the woman grew tired of him and left the relationship . the first half of the film is about the young man ' s plan to win her back . of course the thing is , she doesn ' t want to be won back , and has a nightclub owner friend of hers rough him up a bit . in the fight , the young man grabs a laptop computer belonging to a bystander and attempts to use it to fend off his attacker , but only ends up smashing it against a lamppost . we later find out that the laptop belongs to an older man who wishes to get his damaged computer replaced . there is a funny scene ( the only one in the film ) where the young man tries to use some twisted logic in order to get the older man to seek out the nightclub owner ( baotian li ) in order to recoup his losses . there is no sense to be made out of the young woman ' s behavior ; cold one minute , caring the next , so we feel no sympathy for her character . the bookseller would be better off without her . although the second half of the film causes us to lose a lot of sympathy for the young bookseller as well , who is obsessed with chopping off the nightclub owner ' s hand as revenge for the beating he took , it also offers us some nice interaction between the bookseller and the older man . while the bookseller is blinded by his thirst for revenge , the older man is the voice of reason and tries to rationalize each situation . his quest to end the dispute peacefully and equitably is the one we identify with , but it is frustrating to see that he seems to be talking to a brick wall half the time . a friendship develops between the two men , but it occurs too late in the film for the audience to appreciate . although only an hour and a half in length , keep cool contains extraneous material . the whole plot of how the bookseller is after the young woman could have been taken out , since we don ' t see her from the midpoint on . a case of mistaken identity or some other device could have served as the point of conflict between the bookseller and the nightclub owner , and would have saved us from the bookseller ' s boring pursuit during the first half . but of course , this would have shortened the movie to less than an hour . there are a few things that keep cool does right . as mentioned before , the interaction between the bookseller and the older man is generally pretty good . although it grows tiresome , the reasoning with the unreasonable is a nice exercise in logic , and represents the differences in thinking between generations . in one scene , for example , the bookseller quotes confucius to get his point across , but the older man claims the quote was misinterpreted , and that it means something entirely different . also effective is the way zhang sets up tension within a scene , such as when the bookseller is getting ready to cut off the hand of the unwitting nightclub owner . the nightclub owner is counting out money , slapping each bundle of currency on the table . with every shot of his hand , we can hardly stand the interminable wait before the bookseller is going to pull out his cleaver and exact his revenge . unfortunately , these crumbs are not enough to overcome the rest of the film ' s shortcomings , and weren ' t enough to prevent that headache from lingering after i left the theater .\",\n",

( it \\' s another of john mcnaughton \\' s coups of casting - against - type , after transforming robert de niro into nerd and bill murray into gangster in mad dog and glory ) . but it is the character of pam who commands centrestage , and ashley judd rises to the challenge with great alternating currents of ferocity and tenderness , making pam into a fascinating yet often infuriating person . if the performance falls short of greatness , however , it is perhaps because the role of the mad woman has been done so often before it is virtually a staple of cinema , whether it \\' s in betty blue , tom & viv or georgia . as in those movies , there \\' s the danger that the performance seems mannered , a collection of screwy tics and tantrums designed for the oscar presentation piece . judd doesn \\' t entirely avoid this pitfall , but pam \\' s \\' craziness \\' is best and most movingly presented in counterpoint to the more \\' normal \\' chris . when pam reacts to her father - in - law \\' s death by showing up at the funeral in rollerblades and blaring headphones , chris \\' face is the picture of pained restraint . of course , it \\' s the question of what is \\' normal \\' that is asked in normal life . mcnaughton constantly offers up the ironies of the aspirations for the average domestic life and its kinship with insanity . it is the rational chris that loves guns ( \" shooting is about precision , control \" ) and the \\' crazy \\' pam that loves astronomy and yearns for a dog ( who is then called chaos -- \" chaos and you and me . . . we \\' re a real family \" , she notes wryly ) . it is chris \\' methodical mind and his knowledge of police procedure that allows him to be such a successful bank robber ( his well - planned disguise as a bearded , roaring man of terror is another piece of method in madness ) . in the carpark where he sets out for his first robbery , a huge sign on a shopping mall stands out in the background : \" buy - more \" -- the perfectly respectable consumption - crazy american dream that has driven pam to her extravagant purchases , and both of them into desperate situations . it \\' s not a perfect film . some of the dialogue is a touch too banal ( perhaps intentionally ? ) . the use of the punk hardcore soundtrack in pam \\' s crazed scenes comes rather too close to making emotional disturbance seem glamourous and sexy an image which only detracts from the rest of the film . indeed , as in mcnaughton \\' s seminal film henry : portrait of a serial killer , it is the avoidance of glamour or sensationalism , the denial of some of the standard thrills of the outlaw film genre , that gives this determinedly unflashy , moving film its great strengths . mcnaughton has filmed this story with a quiet , coolly \\' realistic \\' method that works far better than any nbk theatrics at unsettling the viewer . the suburbs , with their miles of white - fenced houses and identikit malls , take on a sense of claustrophobic blankness . in its very different way , this makes for as haunting a backdrop as the wide open spaces in terence malick \\' s badlands . while pam shares the yearnings of malick \\' s heroes to escape from ordinary life , chris takes up crime precisely so that they can lead a \\' normal life \\' - their little house on the suburbs is financed by his violent robberies . but these are dreams defined by , constrained by , and even doomed by , the limitations of the \\' normal \\' , conventional world . pam \\' s final scene takes place at the edge of the suburbs , where wild bushes grow -- symbolically the frontier , the outer limits of her society , but also quite literally the end of the road , where there is nowhere left to go but to the final tragic denouement . the flying inkpot \\' s rating system : * wait for the video . * * a little creaky , but still better than staying at home with gotcha ! * * * pretty good , bring a friend . * * * * amazing , potent stuff . * * * * * perfection . see it twice .',\n",

              " ('contact is a film that tries to do several different things . it is intended to present a realistic picture of what alien contact might be like , to restore a sense of wonder and mystery to the issue of extraterrestrial life , to raise questions about science and faith and how they would be relevant in such a situation , and to tell a personal story of a romance between the astronomer dr . ellie arroway ( jodie foster ) and the religious spokesman palmer joss ( matthew mcconaughey ) . the film succeeds wonderfully at its first two goals . the portrayal of the communication from an alien world is much more reasonable ( albeit less immediately engaging ) than , say , the cold - blooded destructiveness of the invaders in independence day or even the complex process of abductions and genetic hybridization that forms the ongoing plot line of tv \\' s the x - files . the aliens in contact seem to be like us - they are more curious than anything else . they know we exist , they want us to know that they exist , and they would like to make the next step and communicate in person . the film wisely refrains from showing us the aliens directly , and between the characters \\' ongoing speculation about the extraterrestrials and the outstanding visuals in the climactic yet enigmatic scene when arroway arrives on the alien world , that sense of wonder and mystery comes through with a force rarely seen since stanley kubrick \\' s 2001 : a space odyssey . most of the film , however , takes place on earth , where there is an extended public debate on how to respond to these aliens . scientists are enthusiastic , ultraconservative religious leaders are wary , and government officials are caught somewhere in between . the debate is fueled largely by dr . arroway \\' s atheism ; she seems the obvious choice to pilot the spacecraft for which the aliens have provided blueprints , but many are wary of sending an atheist as humankind \\' s representative to another species . the film is partly successful in raising and exploring these questions , especially when it reaches a conclusion that suggests that the two approaches - science and faith - could be viewed as complementary rather than diametrically opposed . still , the film falls a little short in its representation of this conflict as it exists in american society . the two \" sides \" are represented primarily by arroway and by far - right fundamentalists , but in reality probably 80 % of americans are neither atheists nor far - right fundamentalists . palmer joss occupies something of a middle ground , but he ultimately becomes distracted by personal motives and comes across as a less - than - ideal spokesman for any ideology . then again , the film does concentrate mostly on public debate , which does , after all , tend to be dominated by extremists , rather than on dinner - table or college - dormitory discussions . contact is accurate in its portrayal of these issues , then , but only within the narrow scope to which it confines itself . the film \\' s one clear failure is in the portrayal of the romance between arroway and joss . for one thing , it resorts to the tired movie clich * that two attractive people will immediately fall in love as soon as they appear on the screen together , as there does not seem to be any other reason for their instant mutual attraction . the romance rarely , if ever , sheds any light on the characters , although it occasionally tries and fails - joss \\' s explanation that he quit the priesthood because of the celibacy requirement ( \" i guess you could say i \\' m a man of the cloth , but without the cloth \" ) , for example , is more like a punchline to a joke than character development . instead , the romance mostly seems to exist for the sake of later plot developments . granted , this is a plot - and idea - driven film and the characters are secondary , but this just seemed like laziness on the writers \\' part more than anything else . the successes of contact , however , far outweigh its failures . even if the social commentary had fizzled altogether ( which it didn \\' t ) , the simple yet mysterious story of alien communication still would have made it a memorable film . contact doesn \\' t quite cover all the bases , but it covers about as much as one could hope for in a two - hour film , and its rejection of big - budget theatrics for a more realistic story is certainly admirable . and i would not be surprised if , ten years from now , contact is mentioned in the same breath as 2001 and blade runner as one of the finest examples of sophisticated and intellectually relevant science fiction .',\n",

              " ('it \\' s ironic that the best films in cinema history are invariably the original director \\' s cut of the film . films such as aliens , the abyss , the wild bunch , blade runner , and terminator 2 are all prime examples of a filmmaker \\' s integrity , later chopped up or mucked with by the studio . the advent of the dvd format has provided a more accessible way to get these original cuts to the public and provide to film freaks like myself the ability to become further enraptured by the extension of such classic films . the dvd release of the original international version of luc besson \\' s 1995 masterpiece the professional , which is known as l ? on around the world , is a prime example of how a good film can become an instant classic as a director \\' s cut . for years , i have heard of an \" international \" version available only in laserdisc format , which has eluded me for years . i even bought a laserdisc player from my uncle don for 100 bucks just to watch certain directors \\' cuts - including l ? on . but after countless searches in laserdisc stores , i could never find it . until now . the film follows the story of l ? on , played by jean reno , a professional hit man for an italian mob crew run by danny aiello . he lives next door to a ferociously independent 12 - year - old girl named mathilda - played by then newcomer natalie portman , whose father is involved in drugs and crooked cops . one day , a crew of the cops - lead by gary oldman in an over - the - top performance - kills her entire family while mathilda is out buying groceries . taking pity on her , l ? on hides her in his apartment when she returns to save her life . mathilda learns of l ? on \\' s hit man profession and decides to follow in l ? on \\' s footsteps as a \" cleaner . \" she then falls in love with him and manages to reawaken emotions within l ? on he has kept locked away as part of his profession . at this point , the differences in the american version and the international version really kick in . the international version contains an additional 24 minutes of footage that pertains directly to the relationship of l ? on and mathilda , footage that american censors deemed \" too explicit . \" i assume that american censors feel that defining character development is too much for american audiences to handle . the best part of this extra footage is that gives better understanding of both mathilda \\' s and l ? on \\' s motivations pertaining to later actions involving oldman and his crew of bad cops . there \\' s even a previously unseen cameo by the great french actor jean - hugues anglade - star of queen margot , besson \\' s la femme nikita , and killing zoe . with these additional scenes replaced , l ? on and matilda \\' s relationship brings you emotionally closer to the film and draws stronger bonds between the characters that were murky in the american version . the most ironic thing about the international version of the film is that with the inclusion of the missing scenes , the film becomes primarily a heavy , emotional drama punctuated with big action scenes at the beginning and the end of the film . the film betters reflects the serious drama of french cinema but is laced with pieces reflecting the brutality of american cinema . my advice to everyone out there is to throw away your copy of the professional , throw down twenty bucks , and pick up this newly restored cinematic masterpiece . director / writer : luc besson producer : luc besson , claude besson starring : jean reno , natalie portman , gary oldman , danny aiello',\n",

              " (\"written by john grisham and robert altman ( as al hayes ) directed by robert altman some time ago , a young director was given the opportunity to direct the screen version of a popular novel . the novel was a summer smash , topping best - seller lists across the country and already drawing speculation as to which popular actors of the day might play the leads . the only problem : the novel wasn ' t very good . it was far more pulp than pulitzer . but the director realized that , no matter how pedestrian the prose , this book really grabbed people - that the author , while not a great writer , was a fantastic storyteller . so he took on the project , convinced he could make something happen on screen . the director ? francis ford coppola . the book , of course , was mario puzo ' s the godfather . the rest , as they say in showbiz , was history . by bringing up the godfather , i don ' t mean to suggest that robert altman ' s the gingerbread man is destined for that level of greatness . but the parallel does suggest that it is possible to create great cinema from questionable source material . can you get any more questionable than john grisham ? depends on whom you ask . but there ' s no question that grisham ' s work grabs people . like puzo , grisham is a better storyteller than a writer - unlike fellow hack michael crichton , who is a good idea man but who can ' t tell a well - constructed story from a can of spam . so something in grisham ' s unpublished story of a cocky savannah lawyer who gets involved in a deadly family squabble drew the attention of robert altman , who at 73 years old remains one of america ' s greatest living filmmakers . the result is a gripping thriller that , while falling short of classic cinema , deserves its place in the altman canon . > from its opening shot to the closing credits , the gingerbread man is permeated with a sense of dread , with a fear of the natural destructive forces of the universe . this terrific sense of mood is a classic altman touch . witness said opening shot : we see an aerial view of coastal georgia with its writhing , undulating landscape while the soundtrack grumbles ominously in our ear . we roll over the hills into the town of savannah , then zoom in close on a red sports car speeding over a bridge while its driver chatters oblivious on his cell phone . right away we know that the driver of that car is in for a few surprises . pay attention , boys and girls - this shot was not conceived by john grisham , but by altman . this is what a great director can do for questionable source material . the sports car belongs to rick magruder ( kenneth branagh ) , the aforementioned hotshot attorney who specializes in police brutality cases . magruder has just won a high profile case and celebrates that night with a catered party at his office . outside after the party he meets one of the waitresses , mallory doss ( embeth davidzt ) , just as she realizes her car has been stolen . driven by southern chivalry , a driving rainstorm and his unspoken attraction to the fragile waitress , magruder offers her a ride home . there he learns more about mallory ' s life than he bargained for . her car was stolen by her schizophrenic father dixon ( robert duvall ) , a ted kyzynski - style whacko who has been stalking and terrorizing his own daughter . magruder , perhaps influenced by mallory ' s decision to strip off her wet clothes in front of him , is sympathetic to her plight , and offers to help her get her father committed - right after he sleeps with her , of course . this simple offer of help leads magruder down a dangerous path with a black end . he succeeds in having dixon incarcerated in a mental hospital , and for a moment all appears well . but then dixon ' s crack team of homeless commandos bust him out of the lockup - and suddenly magruder finds himself , mallory and his own children in danger . the cops won ' t lift a finger to help a liberal attorney . his only allies are his faithful assistant lois ( daryl hannah ) and his bumbling private - eye sidekick clyde ( robert downey jr ) . if this predicament wasn ' t bad enough , hurricane geraldo is bearing down on savannah and throwing the world into chaos . altman may provide the atmosphere , but branagh ' s performance holds the gingerbread man together . an accomplished actor when he isn ' t directing himself in vanity productions , branagh does a fine job of making rick a sympathetic hero while casting doubt upon his motives . is his offer of help to mallory an act of kindness , or of egotism ? magruder is so sure of his place in the world that he never considers that he has bitten off more than he can chew until he has to swallow it - and by then it ' s too late . as the plot unfolds , magruder learns that none of us are as secure as we think we are . and life is never so bad that it can ' t get worse . if you ' re familiar with altman ' s work , you ' ll recognize several of his signature techniques . characters are not introduced in establishing shots , but rather are allowed to wander in the background of scenes until their importance becomes apparent . crucial scenes are shot from the outside through windows , making the audience unwitting voyeurs of the action . dialog overlaps and the actors seem to slip naturally into an improvisational style . and of course there ' s my favorite altman technique - the obligatory nude actress shot . thanks to altman , here are some of the actresses i ' ve had the pleasure of seeing naked : sally kellerman , julianne moore , madeline stowe , even frances mcdormand . and now i can add embeth davidtz , who looks quite healthy in the altogether . the naked actress shot has become as ubiquitous to the altman film as the director cameo was to the hitchcock film . is it old - school sexism , or a clever in - joke ? you be the judge . but back to the picture at hand . in the hands of a mere mortal , the gingerbread man would have been a routine thriller , no better or worse than the countless others we ' ve all endured . in the hands of a master like altman , it becomes an exercise in existential doom , in its own way far more successful than scorsese ' s cape fear remake , which tried for the same result . what may prevent it from enduring with altman ' s greatest work is a weak third act - in fact , there really is no third act in grisham ' s story , so it appears that altman had to throw in the hurricane just to jazz things up . but there are true moments of riveting suspense , and great performances by branagh , davidzt and downey jr - more than enough to see you through . that polygram so hated this picture that they tried to steal final cut from altman , and then buried the marketing campaign when he won it back , should tell you how utterly clueless of quality most studios are . they probably wanted it to look more like a time to kill . and that , my friends , should make you very afraid .\",\n",

( the plot by - passes these risks . ) that means , the picture isn \\' t perfect . but it has a lot of virtues as well . \" the bridge on the river kwai \" shows the \" madness \" of war and what it can produce in people \\' s minds . it shows how colonel nicholson becomes possessed by the idea of being a hero and that others ( like shears ) get cynics . and lean \\' s film is an interesting study of characters with clashing interests . these points and the sometimes ironic dialogue make this film an anti - war film ( despite inconsistencies in the treatment of this theme ) . david lean \\' s direction is really effective and atmospherically perfect . his film is highly suspenseful , especially in its dramatic ( if not wholly plausible ) showdown . the film is also well - photographed and has an apt score . alec guinness does a magnificent job of bringing col . nicholson to life and making him such an interesting character . the other actors deliver fine performances as well . i like this extraordinary film despite its weaknesses .

              " ('tom dicillo directs this superficial comedy about superficial people in superficial careers , all searching for deeper meaning . however , they won \\' t find much meaning in the real blonde , and not enough real humor , either . joe ( matthew modine ) is a struggling actor , or he claims to be one , even though he has no credits under his belt . his girlfriend , mary ( catherine keener ) has no pretensions about her career : she \\' s a makeup artist , working for the eccentric fashion photographer blair ( marlo thomas ) and supermodel of the month , sahara ( bridgette wilson ) . sahara , who has acquired a new age spirituality from repeated viewing of the little mermaid , has an on - again , off - again relationship with joe \\' s best friend , bob ( maxwell caulfield ) . however , bob has gotten his biggest break yet : a starring role on a soap opera opposite the beautiful kelly ( daryl hannah ) , who may be that illusive woman he \\' s always pursued : a real blonde . there are some moments of good humor in the real blonde , but not enough . the best stuff is in throwaway details in the background , such as sahara \\' s perfume ads : \" depression - it \\' s not just a state of mind \" . but to find humor in the superficiality of models and actors is to shoot fish in a barrel . and , unfortunately , the film \\' s forays outside the realm of comedy are pathetic . take for example the film \\' s framing device of an old lady and her dog . the story serves absolutely no purpose , makes little sense , and is completely tangential to the main plotlines of the movie . matthew modine and catherine keener have the most sympathetic characters in the film , but they \\' re stuck in the most boring plotlines . modine whines and complains and would be completely pathetic if he was matched against someone stronger than elizabeth berkley , who appears as another struggling actor . keener \\' s character has a stronger edge , but the insult self - defense class ( taught by denis leary , no less ) she is stuck in makes little sense . the movie \\' s running time is under two hours , but it seems like it is well over it . there \\' s just not enough humor to speed things along , and not enough meaning to propel any drama .',\n",

              " ('look back at all the times in your life when there was a fork in the path to the future . some sort of decision had to be made , and , for better or worse , it irrevocably altered the course of your existence . > from time - to - time , everyone thinks about the roads not taken , and how things might have turned out if the choice had been different . perhaps even more dizzying to contemplate is how a seemingly minor action -- catching the 10 am train , for example -- could have an equally profound , yet less obvious , impact . maybe that \\' s where you met your significant other , and , had you reached the platform just a few seconds later ? film makers are no less fascinated by issues of destiny than anyone else , and that \\' s why there \\' s no shortage of movies about this subject . the best of the bunch were probably made by the late polish director krzysztof kieslowski , who was obsessed with questions of fate and chance . these themes weave their way through many of his movies , including decalogue , the double life of veronique , and the triptych of blue , white , and red . however , they are most explicitly examined in a 1981 film called blind chance , where kieslowski presents the three different fates of one man after a minor action ( missing or catching a train ) changes the course of his life . in his autobiography , kieslowski on kieslowski , the director describes his attraction to the concept this way : \" [ the idea is ] rich and interesting ? that every day we \\' re faced with a choice which could end our entire life yet of which we \\' re completely unaware . \" while this approach has been the fodder for several notable dramatic films ( including , in a way , frank capra \\' s it \\' s a wonderful life ) , sliding doors is the first romantic comedy to plumb its depths . the \" road not taken \" approach isn \\' t just a plot device , either . writer / director peter howitt expands upon both possible fates of a character after she just misses / catches a train . the audience watches , with ever - growing fascination , how this one event impacts upon every aspect of her life : her future career , where she lives , whom she loves , and whether she has a family . as her separate destinies diverge and then re - converge , she becomes two completely different individuals . that woman is helen , played by gwyneth paltrow as a long , dark - haired brit . one day , after losing her job as an advertising executive , she decides to return home in the middle of the day . the scene of the pivotal moment is a train platform . in scenario # 1 , she just slips through the sliding doors before the train pulls out of the station . on board , she meets the cheerful , talkative james ( john hannah ) , a monty python fan who is taken with her beauty . minutes later , in her flat , she walks in on her lover , gerry ( john lynch ) , in bed with another woman ( jeanne tripplehorn ) . in scenario # 2 , she misses the train and , shortly thereafter , is the victim of an attempted mugging . she doesn \\' t meet james and fails to make it home in time to discover gerry \\' s infidelity . juxtaposed one against the other , while sharing many places , cues , and characters , the two stories proceed in parallel from there . on one level , for viewers who enjoy pondering the workings of fate , sliding doors can be viewed as a deep and wonderful experience . but , for those who just appreciate a romantic comedy characterized by solid acting , a script with a few twists , and a great deal of genuinely funny material , sliding doors still fits the bill . one of its most obvious strengths is that it can satisfy many different types of audiences -- those who demand something substantial from their motion pictures , and those who could care less . it shouldn \\' t come as any surprise that the acting , at least from three of the four leads , is solid . paltrow , who does double duty as two helens who are initially the same , yet gradually become much different , is the standout . she plays both of her roles effectively and believably -- the shy , insecure woman who stays with gerry and the liberated , platinum - blond who severs the ties to her old life and embarks on a new career with a new man . john hannah , known to most american viewers as the younger gay character in four weddings and a funeral , is instantly likable . john lynch , taking a break from movies about ireland \\' s troubles , does a good job presenting gerry as a inept , selfish philanderer . only jeanne tripplehorn , who plays an over - the - top vixen , seems out of place . her attempts at broad comedy are occasionally jarring , and it \\' s occasionally difficult to see her lydia as anything more than a plot element . one member of the supporting cast deserves special notice . douglas mcferran , who plays gerry \\' s best friend , russell , is an absolute delight , stealing every scene that he \\' s in . part of this is surely because he is given the best lines in the movie . on one occasion , he has a marvelous monologue bemoaning how advances in the telecommunications industry have trapped men into a life of monogamy . on another occasion , while laughing at gerry \\' s plight with the women in his life , he comments , \" being with you makes the wait for the next episode of seinfeld more bearable . \" but it \\' s not all in the dialogue . mcferran tears into this part with relish ; his performance becomes one of the most memorable aspects of a top - notch comedy . this is the first feature film for peter howitt , and he approaches the task with unimpeachable aplomb . the script is shrewd and inventive , combining wit , romance , and intelligent melodrama into a crowd - pleasing whole . sliding doors grants more than just a good time at the movies , however . for those who are so inclined , its central theme offers an opportunity to ponder some of the more philosophical questions about the workings of the universe -- all while having a good time .',\n",

              " ('i \\' m not quite sure what to say about mars attacks ! , which is obviously the work of a deranged genius . when tim burton \\' s twisted alien invasion comedy really works , it \\' s breathtaking and hilarious in equal measure . and when it doesn \\' t work , it \\' s just dull . i \\' m not even sure it works more often than it doesn \\' t , but where it counts -- that is , when this gleefully evil invading force from the red planet gets down to the business of blasting us to kingdom come -- mars attacks ! is brilliant . mars attacks ! is based on a rather unsavory series of trading cards released by topps in the 1950s , and it takes its cues from the same sources as this summer \\' s independence day -- old alien invasion flicks , disaster movies , and big - budget special effects extravaganzas . but unlike independence day , which was a painfully middle - of - the - road appeal to the hearts , minds and wallets of america , mars attacks ! has a fully developed and very personal sense of wonder about it . the big difference is that while independence day celebrated the resilience of human beings , mars attacks ! portrays us as the greedy and hapless schmucks that we are . the title sequence is just splendid -- an incredible swarm of flying saucers rises out of the canals of the red planet and then storms earthward through the solar system in formation . the spinning metal saucers are dead ringers for the invading forces of movies past , and their first appearance on the big screen in combination with danny elfman \\' s thundering , theremin - driven score is absolutely jaw - dropping . it \\' s so overwhelming that , i swear to you , i had trouble breathing . the movie lays low for the next 40 minutes . we get a glimpse of the alien leader , resplendent in a purple - sequined cape , when a television message is broadcast to the people of the world -- naturally , the only way to communicate with earthlings is to preempt our regularly scheduled programming . but mostly , the first act is spent developing characters , setting up mildly comic situations , and drawing a quirky but dishearteningly drab picture of america according to tim burton . it \\' s a good thing that the most compelling personality in the movie belongs to the aliens , because burton \\' s just not interested in making more than caricatures out of his human stars . anyone who comes to mars attacks ! expecting to see a lot of one favorite actor is bound to be disappointed -- with few exceptions , these characters are dispatched as the film progresses . jack nicholson is a lot of fun as the president of the united states but fizzles as a sleazy las vegas hotel developer . rod steiger does an amusing enough take on dr . strangelove \\' s buck turgidson , glenn close brings some star power to the role of the first lady , and martin short is a presidential aide who meets the martians in the white house \\' s \" kennedy room , \" a secluded nook where he unwittingly tries to seduce an alien dressed up as a big - haired , pointy - breasted sexpot ( lisa marie , the burton flame who played vampira in ed wood ) -- in an earlier scene , it \\' s made clear that the aliens studied human sexuality in the pages of an old issue of playboy . sarah jessica parker hosts her own tv show and michael j . fox is her newsman husband . the octogenarian sylvia sidney has a funny part as the old woman who cackles , \" they blew up congress ! \" and plays a decisive role in the defeat of the alien menace . jim brown and tom jones are the film \\' s vegas - based heroes , and director barbet schroeder ( reversal of fortune ) has a funny cameo as the unfortunate french president . also on hand and underutilized are annette bening , pierce brosnan , pam grier , lukas haas and natalie portman ( the latter two also show up in woody allen \\' s everyone says i love you ) . the real stars , of course , are the computer - generated martians , and they \\' re fantastic . with bare brains glistening atop their grinning skull - faces , round egg - eyes with red pupils darting this way and that , these animated invaders are malevolence incarnate -- joe dante \\' s gremlins are the closest equivalent in recent memory , but burton \\' s little monsters are more inventive . the film \\' s raison d \\' etre are the scenes of crimes against mankind -- the most famous monuments of the world crumble under the alien assault , easter island is turned into a bowling alley , and the nasty little buggers perform hideous medical experiments on captured humans . the sheer level of mayhem is staggering , especially when the aliens make their first attack , blasting human beings into iridescent skeletons . parents are urged to pay special attention to the pg - 13 rating -- it \\' s earned . the special effects vary from charming to astonishing to deliciously cheesy , and at least a couple of shots of mass destruction seem to have been engineered specifically in response to independence day , although mars attacks ! was in production long before that film \\' s release . cinematographer peter suschitzky , who makes the most of wynn thomas \\' s wildly imaginative production design ( thomas helped define the spike lee style ) , actually took time off from his mars attacks ! regimen to shoot crash for david cronenberg . cronenberg \\' s movie will almost certainly be more somber -- it won \\' t be released in the u . s . until early next year -- but mars attacks ! is surely a similarly elegant nightmare . this is not a nice movie . ( and which studio executive was duped into giving burton $ 70 million to make it ? ) by setting the film \\' s final scenes in the nearly empty , holocaust - ravaged america that independence day conveniently avoided , burton \\' s invasion epic suggests that the world we \\' ve got may not be worth saving until many of the people on it are dead . the victims of his invasion are naive , greedy , or disastrously self - absorbed -- and a good thing , too , since the movie \\' s wicked charm is dependent on our ability to take this invasion partly as a wish - fulfillment fantasy . the surviving cast members are the innocents and the entertainers , who triumph by determining that the alien invaders -- the ultimate elitists -- are actually susceptible to the kitschiest strains of american pop culture . ultimately , this messy masterpiece is the year \\' s funniest comedy and a weird , winking affirmation of the power of the people .',\n",

coming out of limousines , walking the red carpets and such . without words , this sequence gives us a background to her character . following , however , is a set - up narration by william indicating what he does and where he lives . i don \\' t know why the filmmakers chose to go with a narration which tells us nothing we couldn \\' t have figured out by watching the first ten minutes of film , and which never resurfaces after the movie \\' s beginning , but there it is . if there were ever a clear case for \" less is more , \" this would be it . the film is told nearly first person from william \\' s point of view , as he is in every scene . by nature of this arrangement , we get a very definite sense of what he is all about , and his nice guy personality wins us over easily . in fact , much of notting hill \\' s strength lies in the great dialog written for this character by richard curtis . a scene where william is still in shock over the fact that he \\' s even talking to a silver screen goddess is made golden by the way bumbles through his attempt to offer her some honey - soaked apricots from his refrigerator . or take an instance where anna kisses william and asks him never to tell anyone for fear of the incident hurting her image . william assures her he wouldn \\' t say a word , then adds , \" well , i \\' ll probably tell myself now and then , but i \\' d never believe it . \" great stuff . the downside to spending so much time with william is that we don \\' t get to see enough of anna to make their relationship whole and plausible . we \\' re constantly exposed to william \\' s thoughts , feelings , actions and desires , but don \\' t actually get the sense of how much anna really feels for him . there are a couple of instances where she declares her obvious interest , but they nearly come out of nowhere due to the fact that we \\' re not sure what she \\' s been thinking all the times in between . this , combined with the sheer iniquity of screen time between the two , makes this hugh grant \\' s film hands down . he gets the great scenes ( look for one in which he has to portray an interviewer from horse and hound magazine in order to speak with anna ) , the great lines , and gives an overall wonderful performance . julia roberts fans will probably be disappointed by the actress \\' s top billing and subsequent lack of involvement in the film ( ala sandra bullock in a time to kill ) along with her detached performance which is only worsened by her character \\' s unpredictable behavior . anna doesn \\' t get a lot of our compassion . this romantic comedy leans a little more toward the comedy than the romance , much of it supplied by grant himself , but with considerable help from the supporting cast . most notable is rhys ifans as spike , william \\' s eccentric roommate , who is in the film for no other purpose than to make us laugh . hugh bonneville , emma chambers , james dreyfus , and gina mckee bring up the guard as william \\' s friends and family , particularly shining in a scene where william brings anna to his sister \\' s birthday dinner , and we get to see how these common folks react to the presence of a movie star in their midst . it \\' s a scene most of us will probably think would play out in our own living rooms were we faced with a similar situation . roger michell \\' s use of visuals doesn \\' t sweep us off our feet , but does give us more than your typical movie of this type . for example , there are a couple of instances in this film where large amounts of time pass . whereas some films are content to simply put in a caption saying \" eight months later , \" michell presents us with more interesting cues , such as william \\' s walk though his neighborhood while the seasons change around him . another memorable shot occurs in a park where the camera is lifted from ground level to a couple of hundred feet in the air . we \\' re generally used to scenes where our point of view is lifted from the earth to treetop level or so , but in this case , the camera just keeps going up and up until we have a bird \\' s eye view of the ground below . music is used rather glaringly as an enhancement to many of the film \\' s scenes , and some of this might have been better toned down , but in other areas it works to full effect . it \\' s kind of a mixed bag , but still fares better than many of today \\' s lighthearted movies which are so influenced by the mtv fare that the film becomes one long music video . at least this film has some pretty good music that for the most part remains relevant and appropriate . notting hill \\' s grant and roberts will not go down in history as one of the all - time greatest film pairings , but the chemistry is decent and the comedic aspects of the movie more than make up for it . for a couple of hours , you should expect to laugh more than cry , and that \\' s not so bad , now is it ?',\n",

              " ('the ultimate match up between good and evil , \" the untouchables \" is an excellent movie because it looks deeper into an already examined rivalry . based on the 1959 television show of the same title , \" the untouchables \" may be an exaggeration of the real life events that took place , but it fits together perfectly with some beautifully filmed action sequences , some excellent acting , a memorable score , and a clever script . the film takes place in chicago during the prohibition era where mobsters led by the ruthless al capone run an underground market of liquor to the demanding public . elliot ness and a small force of men known as the untouchables attempt the impossible by trying to stop capone and trying to maintain peace and order . however , as ness soon learns , in order to stabilize peace , you have to bend a few laws . the fact that capone is evil is very apparent from the first few scenes . the film begins with capone , played perfectly by deniro , declaring that he is not a violent man and he is a firm believer in following all laws . the film then quickly transfers to the next scene in which one of capone \\' s men bombs a restaurant that contains many innocent people including a little girl . from this point we know capone is evil , not only because he kills without hesitation , but also because he is a lying bastard . right from the first five minutes of the film , de palma has created a hatred towards capone and he shows that this man must be brought down at all costs . this developed hatred is before the film \\' s hero , ness , is even introduced . i found this approach to be very clever because in a small duration of time there is a great amount of admiration for ness and an equal amount of hatred for capone . the film only gets better from this point . with the formation of the untouchables , there is a group of men wearing long , dark overcoats and hats . they walk in unison and they only look forward . as they walk down the streets they are observed and feared by citizens . holding shot guns and pistols in their hands to stop criminals , this image of vigilantes must have influenced future films . one that comes to mind is \" the matrix \" when neo , morpheus , trinity , and the rest of the gang first come into the virtual world . wearing more futuristic outfits of the same 1930 \\' s style , the similarities between these two are countless . \" the untouchables \" has some of the hippest , bravest heroes in any action film . the four members were the only ones willing to go against capone \\' s army . each member of this special group also had their own characteristics that separated them from others . elliot ness , played with perfect ingenuity by kevin costner , is a character that surely grows during the course of the film . he begins as a man who is determined to follow all laws no matter how unfair they may be . however , as the film develops so does ness . his beliefs involving the law are shattered when he realizes that those he trusted are actually members of the other side . he also begins to lose his stability when his adversaries begin to murder his friends . his anger becomes so thunderous that he can no longer hold it in . sean connery , who won an academy award for best supporting actor in his role , plays malone , an aging cop who decides to make one final run as a member of the untouchables . malone acts as a mentor to ness . he teaches him \" the chicago way \" to do things ; when they attack with a knife , you attack with a gun . connery plays his character with the exact amount of wit and experience needed . andy garcia does a wonderful job as george stone , a young man who is just becoming a police officer . as ness grows , he begins to teach stone some valuable lessons that malone once taught him . charles martin smith is also fantastic as the final member who attempts to use an income tax offense against capone . smith is perfect for his role as he adds some valuable comic relief to the film . the action scenes are also some of the most beautifully choreographed i have ever seen . also very similar to \" the matrix , \" they are exciting and intense . > from a western - like battle to the famous confrontation at the train station steps , the scenes are well thought out and well executed . the score during these scenes ingeniously adds to the excitement . its pounding drum beats act as a rhythm for the actors . the combination of image and music is very impressive and also very effective . although the real life untouchables may have been excessively glorified , this film is pure entertainment and contains a unique blend of great acting , great directing , and great action . some scenes ( capone and the baseball bat , the train station ) have stuck in my mind for years and seeing them again will only make them more vivid .',\n",

minded about a challenging script , read on , for there is something rotten in the state of denmark . namely , the king has died , and his widow the queen has wed the king \\' s brother , claudius , but prince hamlet suspects foul play . his suspicions are confirmed when the ghost of his father appears and relates the story of his murder at his own brother \\' s hands . hamlet , enlisting the help of his friend horatio , conspires to capture the conscience of the new king to expose his treachery . . . . and the game is afoot . . . . the first things you notice about this production are the sets and costumes . with external scenes filmed at blemheim palace in england ( also the one of the sites for the recent the avengers ) , the grandiose quality of the setting is immediately established . interior scenes are similarly graced with intricate and flamboyant rooms and chambers . the hamlet castle \\' s grand throne room is an impressive piece of work incorporating high ceilings , mirror - panel doors , and bridges which connect opposite sides of a second - story loft . costuming is equally grand , drawing upon both history and imagination . . not quite the denmark of the 1600 \\' s , the characters \\' attire is something of a cross between that era and turn of the century russia , very effectively giving the film more of a timeless feel . it is not surprising that tim harvey and alexandra byrne were nominated for best art direction and best costume design oscars , respectively . in addition to directing , kenneth branagh also plays the title character . as the revenge - driven royal heir , branagh provides a riveting performance of emotional highs and lows . from the anticipation of seeing his father \\' s ghost , to the melancholy of finding the burial site of his childhood jester , to his eventual wrath , branagh delivers in spades . every scene truly revolves around hamlet , as much a tribute to branagh \\' s acting and directing as to shakespeare \\' s manuscript . hamlet seems to be a who \\' s who of shakespearean - trained actors , so watching them perform the craft for which they have much love is a delight in itself . julie christie , as hamlet \\' s mother gertrude , and derek jacobi as his murderous uncle claudius both fill the classic roles superbly , as do many of the supporting players . kate winslet as hamlet \\' s lover ophelia , does an outstanding job demonstrating the character \\' s plummet to the depths of dispair and madness . richard briers as ophelia \\' s father , polonius , and michael moloney as her brother , laertes , are equally convincing . nicholas farrell as hamlet \\' s trusted friend horatio , and timothy spall and reece dinsdale as the two - timing rosencrantz and guildenstern round out the excellent core cast . hamlet also seems to be a film in which someone tried to stuff as many well known actors as possible . in some cases , this made for interesting scenes . billy crystal is surprisingly good as the gravedigger who unearths the skull of yorick , whom hamlet knew quite well . crystal proves himself able to deliver the lines with both the timing of a classic actor and the verbal countenance of a comedian , and the result is a very funny scene . however , charleton heston , whom many might think would butcher shakespeare , is the biggest surprise of all . as the player king , the leader of a troupe of traveling actors , he is absolutely breathtaking when narrating the story of priam and hecuba . part of his monologue is overlaid with a visual enactment of the story ( with sir john gielgud and judi dench ) , but this is most unfortunate , for it robs heston of some of the attention which he deserves at this time . his off - camera speaking , while gripping , sort of downplays the scene to a narration done by any other well - voiced actor . i wish branagh had chosen to allow us to envision in our own minds the scene which heston lays out , and let the venerable actor have the attention . unfortunately , there were some casting choices which led to poor distractions . jack lemmon , an excellent actor , just can \\' t do shakespeare . as marcellus , the guard who sees the elder hamlet \\' s ghost , lemmon sadly underperforms and is shown up left and right by those around him . gerard depardieu , another talented actor , is wasted when given little more than the utterances of \" yes , my lord \" and \" no , my lord \" in the role of reynaldo . richard attenborough has a ( literally ) walk - on role , showing up at the eleventh hour as the english ambassador . i think he had two lines . then there is rufus sewell as fortinbras of norway . when i went to see dangerous beauty earlier this year , two ladies behind me kept commenting about how handsome he was . if bulging eyes are your idea of handsome , well i guess comic actor marty feldman was some kind of sex symbol to you . hamlet is a complicated tale of treachery and revenge in which triumph and defeat become one . branagh attempts to help us out with some of the intricacies by visually representing some of the more elusive stretches of dialogue by presenting them as flashback -

well , yes it does . and it may make you think twice before you consider dating anyone your office . for the uninitiated , newcomers aaron eckhart and matt malloy play chad and howard , two corporate drones who are dispatched by their nameless company to a remote branch office for a six week assignment . chad and howard are archetypes , examples of which you can no doubt find in your own place of business . chad is the blond golden boy , genetically engineered for success , the natural charmer who seems to glide effortlessly up the corporate ladder . howard is chad \\' s boss , but he is weaker of will , the clumsy practitioner of office politics who has achieved his position through dogged persistence rather than raw talent . we first meet them awaiting their flight in a drab airport lounge . there chad suggests a scheme worthy of a shakespearean villain : he and howard will find a vulnerable single woman at the branch office , woo her simultaneously , win her love , and then dump her . the reason ? both men have recently been dumped themselves , and chad sees an easy route to revenge against the fairer sex . \" it \\' ll restore a little dignity to our lives , \" he says . howard , helpless against the force of chad \\' s will , agrees to the plan . they quickly spot their prey in the form of christine ( stacy edwards ) , a fragile deaf woman working as a temp . chad moves in for the kill , flashing his golden boy smile , plying christine with lunch , then flowers , then dinner . howard follows suit , though his efforts are in contrast ham - handed and desperate . flattered to have the attention of two eligible men , christine dates them both . you can guess which one she falls for . soon a tragic lovers \\' triangle develops : christine loves chad , chad loves himself , and howard loves christine on the grounds that , since she \\' s handicapped and shy , she just might be wretched and lonely enough to settle for him . adult social interaction never really progresses beyond the level of junior high , does it ? in chad , writer / director labute and actor eckhart have created one of the most chilling monsters ever committed to film - hannibal lector may eat human flesh , but chad is an eater of souls . his evil is as subtle as a viper \\' s , and as easy as his smile . we watch in stunned disbelief as he back - stabs coworkers , humiliates his subordinates , and works his deadly venom into christine \\' s heart . his character would be a joke if he wasn \\' t so chillingly real - all of us have worked with a chad , and some of us may be him . he \\' s the guy who takes your job and then laughs at you for your weakness . if one of his co - workers should happen to go postal and walk into the office with a bag full of handguns , he had best have his escape route clearly in mind . politics is his game , and the modern cubicle - filled office is his playground . men wears the guise of a black comedy , but it functions best as allegory . the most controversial moment in the film happens when chad humiliates a black temp by asking him how badly he wants to succeed in the company , then forces him to prove it in a manner i won \\' t describe . the scene is charged with racism and fraught with peril . could it happen in the real world ? probably not . taken as allegory , however , it is representative of the treatment of the meek by the powerful in all facets of society . maybe it \\' s just the english major in me , but chad , in his motiveless cruelty towards christine and his careful manipulation of howard , can be seen as a symbol of unbridled capitalism , of greed without conscience . the entire film is a metaphor for social darwinism - only the strong will survive . the marvel of labute \\' s multi - layered script is that it can disturb each member of its audience in an entirely different way . but does the film work as entertainment ? its darned funny in spots , particularly in the men \\' s room scenes , which demonstrate the lengths to which guys will go to hold a conversation while engaged in the most basic of bodily functions . it works less well as drama , since by necessity the characters in an allegory tend to be flat ciphers . stacy edwards gives a measured dignity to christine , and succeeds in making us care for her , but by the end of the film we still know nothing about her . likewise , chad and howard are simply the sum of their actions . by the end of the film you \\' ll feel as if you \\' ve met a genuine monster in chad ; perhaps we can also classify men as a horror film . certainly those expecting a conventional hollywood resolution to the story will walk away disappointed . but the picture is often mesmerizing , and the script is a work of fine craftsmanship , which makes it well worth your time . like all good films , it offers a myriad of parallels to the outside world . while watching chad in his moment of triumph , i couldn \\' t help but think that bill gates must have felt the same sort of cold , merciless satisfaction when he finally stuck it to steve jobs . there may be a little bit of chad in all of us , but some of us have taken chad - ness to the level of art .',\n",

( hint : a ______ killed his _____ when he was just a _____ . ) at least _blade_ had decent action and slick stylishness . _vampires_ lacks even cheap thrills to mask its gossamer - thin plot . to make up for this , the movie resorts to other \" shocks , \" such as its generally condescending attitude towards women ( crow slaps them around for the fun of it ) and an overplayed contempt for religion ( crow teases guiteau incessantly about whether his vow of celibacy has made him prone to \" getting woodies . \" ) it can be argued that maybe i wanted too much from this movie . if not scary and gory , i wanted tense , relentless , and exhausting . _john carpenter \\' s vampires_ is none of these . i can only recommended it for the hardcore carpenter fan . for the rest of you looking for a good scare , beware : _vampires_ is a film with no teeth .',\n",

( some wags have compared this to windows 95 . ) it \\' s up to asuma shinohara , labor command officer with sv2 and the son of the president of shinohara heavy industries , to find the source of these problems before more labors -- including sv2 \\' s own -- fall victim to them , and before hos drags his father \\' s company down with it . as was the case with _ghost in the shell_ , if you just want a no - brainer actionfest , this might not be the movie for you . _patlabor : the movie_ is more of a psychological thriller , a technological suspense drama . it is closer , perhaps , to a chrichton novel than to an action movie ( crichton novels that have been made _into_ action movies notwithstanding ) . there are long , thoughtful montages of dialogueless footage as two investigators make their way through slums and derelict housing in old quarters of tokyo , similar to sequences from _ghost in the shell_ . this movie is fraught with symbolism -- in fact a large part of it is based on christian symbolism . patlabor \\' s near - future setting is , aside from the giant robots tromping around , very similar to our own present day . the film uses this setting to make its central point : is progress moving too fast for humans to keep up ? are history and culture falling by the wayside like the old buildings that are being torn down and replaced with new ? this is a question just as applicable to today as it is to patlabor \\' s alternate - 1999 setting . as far as the technical aspects of the film go ( referring to the subtitled version , as that \\' s the only one i \\' ve seen ) , the film transfer is clear , almost phenomenally so . the animation quality is incredible , though the character design is different from what most patlabor fans will be used to . the oavs and tv series were more cheerful , better - suited to humor ; the movie , however , makes everyone look a great deal less cute , and emphasizes that this is going to be , for the most part , a deadly serious storyline . as far as cinematography goes , there are many interesting moments in _patlabor : the movie_ . i don \\' t think i can recall ever seeing a fish - eye perspective used in any other animated film ( save for _ghost in the shell_ , another oshii film ) , or indeed , in many other movies at all . the cinematography is well - suited to the storyline , emphasizing what it needs to , though a couple of scenes ( where characters \\' features are exaggerated in anger ) may seem slightly strange to western audiences . the audio track of _patlabor : the movie_ is in glorious hi - fi stereo , and should be used to demonstrate home theater systems -- it _is_ that good . even without headphones , sounds from either side of the screen can be clearly heard to _come_ from that side . giant robot footsteps are deep and booming . the sometimes - understated , sometimes - blaring score is crisp and clear , and always right on the mark , enhancing the moods created by the animated scenery . as far as the subtitles go , i have to say that they \\' re among the most easily - readable subtitles i \\' ve ever seen for _anything_ . large enough that they don \\' t strain the eyes , but small enough not to conceal too much of the screen . although it does have several action sequences in it , most notably the climactic conclusion , _patlabor_ is foremost not an action movie . although it is a superbly - realized film , it relies in large part upon prior familiarity with some of the characters to carry the story , and that could detract from some people \\' s enjoyment . my .',\n",

              " (\"i ' ve never been a member of the robin williams fan club . a little bit of his improvisationaly schtick goes a long way , and i sometimes feel as though i ' m watching a 40 - year - old class clown . in his films , williams has often tried to balance his mania with touchy - feely emotion , leading to wildly uneven performances . mrs . doubtfire seemed ready - made for the same problems , but instead it proves to be williams ' best comic screen project yet . while it still contains some characteristic self - indulgence , mrs . doubtfire is nonetheless an engaging belly - laugh comedy served up with high energy . williams stars as daniel hillard , a cartoon voiceover artist with a penchant for irresponsible behavior . one such incident proves one too many for wife miranda ( sally field ) , and she files for a divorce . unemployed , living in a disastrously unkempt apartment and faced with limited time with his three beloved children , daniel decides to respond to miranda ' s ad for an afternoon housekeeper . he turns to his brother frank ( harvey fierstein ) , a theatrical makeup artist , and emerges as euphegenia doubtfire , a matronly 65 - year - old englishwoman . daniel uses his access to the house to keep an eye on miranda ' s flirtation with a wealthy client ( pierce brosnan ) , to spend time with the children , and to learn something about responsible parenting , all the while trying to keep his identity hidden from the people who know him best . mrs . doubtfire has to overcome a mountain of implausibilities to work , and basically it does so . the most crucial is that no one in the family recognizes daniel , and thanks to the fantastic special makeup that ' s instantly believable . it may be one of the most convincing transformations ever committed to film , making dustin hoffman ' s dorothy michaels look like milton berle . more problematic was a series of calls daniel makes to miranda posing as nannies from hell ; it ' s a bit hard to swallow that she doesn ' t recognize any of the voices as her husband ' s . perhaps the biggest contrivance we ' re asked to swallow is that daniel could make a quick change into mrs . doubtfire in a few minutes . there ' s more to realistic makeup than slapping on a latex mask . fortunately , these are inconsistencies which only attract attention as the credits roll . during the film , i was generally too busy laughing . after getting off to a slow start involving too much of williams ' riffing , mrs . doubtfire kicks into high gear once the wig and pads are in place . daniel ' s frantic attempt to fool a court officer is wonderful , as is the climactic restaurant sequence , even though i saw the resolutions coming a mile away . clearly , most of the credit for doubtfire ' s success goes to robin williams . it took putting him in drag , but for once he plays a comic character that isn ' t just robin williams with a different name . he thoroughly inhabits euphegenia doubtfire , and seems to relish the scenes in which he gets to play her as blunt and foul - mouthed . wisely , he never aims for saintly . his responses to the intrusion of new suitor stu are often petty , but the kind of thing most of us might do with the benefit of anonymity . it ' s one of mrs . doubtfire ' s charms that neither daniel nor miranda is perfect , just people trying to be better . as miranda , sally field is solid in a background role , and pierce brosnan is nicely understated as stu . the children are also good , although mara wilson is almost oppressively cute as the youngest . the supporting players merely step aside and allow williams to do his thing . it ' s easy to see mrs . doubtfire as little more than tootsie warmed over , and it ' s true that there are both broad themes and specific details in common . but mrs . doubtfire manages to carve out its own space , particularly through the surprisingly honest moments involving a judge ' s decision and the ultimate status of daniel and miranda ' s relationship . there ' s nothing dazzlingly new in mrs . doubtfire , but there are plenty of laughs , and good comedies are always in short supply . and it ' s nice to see robin williams just act for a change .\",\n",

              " ('note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . be forewarned . james toback \\' s return to directing after a eight - year layoff , two girls and a guy , is a film which is comprised , more or less , of just that : one guy , blake ( robert downey jr . ) ; two girls , carla ( heather graham ) and lou ( natasha gregson wagner ) ; one primary setting ( blake \\' s absurdly spacious bachelor apartment ) , and a great deal of dialogue . embracing a near real - time approach , this is a highly theatrical feature that completely hangs upon the performances of its three actors and the quality of the dialogue written by mr . toback for his bantering characters . fortunately , the film \\' s cast is up to the challenge , and the wordy exchanges between the triad of characters , while admittedly variable , are occasionally wickedly amusing . the film \\' s setup is fairly generic in nature , and opens rather unpromisingly . we meet self - possessed blonde carla and feisty brunette lou , both waiting outside a soho loft . as they engage in idle chatter , it is revealed that they \\' re both waiting for their respective boyfriends to return from the airport , and it doesn \\' t take long for them to come to the realisation that they \\' re being two - timed by the same guy . more indignant with him than catty with each other , the duo break into blake \\' s loft and await his arrival for a confrontation . it \\' s when blake returns to his abode where the film hits its stride . played with magnificent bombast by mr . downey jr . , blake is a cad , all right , but a captivatingly dynamic , blusterous , and stealthy piece of work that bursts onto the scene and raises the stakes to new heights . it \\' s fascinating to watch this character in his natural habitat , and perhaps the film \\' s best choice was to have his two girlfriends scamper off into hiding upon his return , allowing us to size up blake not with his interactions with others , but by his own innate behaviour . whether he \\' s flamboyantly behind his piano in a rollicking rendition of vivaldi , or on the phone leaving messages to his beloveds ( carla , lou , and his unseen sickly mother ) , it \\' s never less than wildly entertaining and insightful . though at this point i almost hoped the film would transform into a one - man show -- a typical afternoon in the life of blake , if you will -- carla , and then lou , reveal themselves , and the sparks begin to fly . ( one of the great touches in the film is how blake , when startled by carla \\' s unannounced appearance , begins to both verbally and physically backpedal even before he realizes that the cat \\' s out of the bag . ) double - teamed by the understandably aggrieved women ( who are more smirkingly inquisitive than ferociously vengeful -- they want a justification for his ongoing hypocrisy ) , an increasingly - flustered blake weakly defends himself with apologetic and even self - righteous declarations against their verbal jabs . surprisingly delightful in the waltz of scathing witty banter shared by its trio of characters , two girls and a guy concludes its first sequence with an unexpected apoplectic act of such outrageous audacity that it seemed nothing was off - limits for this film . however , it \\' d be unfeasible to attempt to string along carla and lou \\' s outrage to full feature - length , and it \\' s as the movie gradually transforms into the sharing of exploratory profundities on the nature of fidelity and relationships that it slowly but surely begins to unravel . the dialogue becomes less and less engaging and clever , the film \\' s tempo loses its liveliness , the dynamic between the characters evolves in unconvincing fashion , and several sequences fall flat . subtle and not - quite - subtle allusions are made ( a poster of jules et jim hangs prominently on the wall ) , and secrets are revealed which barrel the film toward an uncompelling weepy finale . one key turning point in the film is the kinky sex scene between blake and carla . two girls and a guy was embroiled in a bitter , long - running dispute with the mpaa with regards to this scene -- contractually - obligated to deliver an r - rated film , mr . toback was forced to resubmit fourteen scaled - down versions of the steamy interlude before the mpaa withdrew their nc - 17 rating in favour of an r -- and while admittedly titillating , the net effect of the vignette on the film \\' s thematic narrative is rather dubious . if anything , two girls and a guy serves as a showcase for the phenomenal talents of mr . downey jr . , whose versatility is put to the test in this film . he plays the gamut from indignant to humbled , from self - assured to disconcerted , yet his acting gears shift so smoothly as to not be registered . it \\' s a wonderful performance in a role custom - tailored for him ; mr . toback wrote the screenplay in four days shortly after mr . downey jr . was arrested on drug charges , and it \\' s hard not to see echoes of reality seeping into his character -- in a monologue to his mirrored reflection , blake \\' s self - chiding to \" get [ his ] shit together \" is disquieting in its resonance . while mr . downey jr . \\' s showstopping performance is undoubtedly the primary strength of the film , both actresses are solid in more broadly - observed roles . ms . graham is quickly becoming one of america \\' s more daring actresses , involving herself in three successive risky projects -- two girls and a guy and boogie nights are both quite sexually frank , while lost in space has a screenplay penned by akiva goldsman . she \\' s quite appealing here , playing a character at once both dainty and sultry . meanwhile , ms . gregson wagner initially portrays lou with such an unwarranted spunk that audiences are likely to find it either annoying , or , like me , endearing . she tones it down substantially as the film progresses , but i found her more fun to watch as the artificially excitable chatterbox . the film was reportedly shot in eleven days , filmed mostly in sequence , and the resultant artifacts of this rapid shoot are evident throughout . two girls and a guy has an agile , spontaneous sort of feel , and one senses that mr . toback encouraged a good deal of improvisation from his three actors . while the film could be transposed directly to the stage more or less intact , it doesn \\' t feel constricted ; the expansive apartment setting is well - used to vary the background , and mr . toback allows his camera to wander and linger on his characters in an effective manner . two girls and a guy falls short of its potential , but thanks to some stellar work by mr . downey jr . , it \\' s still often an enjoyable , bitingly funny romp , particularly as we watch the surprisingly - resilient blake evasively try to rationalize his behaviour and even turn the tables on his girlfriends . \" i \\' m an actor , \" he tells them at one point , using the ol \\' tried - and - tested occupational - hazard defense . \" actors lie . \" but not , they all seem to agree , denzel washington .',\n",

( perhaps i ' m just annoyed that the release of ` the peacemaker ' in the us overshadowed a far superior thriller , ` the assignment ' . ) it is very obvious that the title not only represents the big boom that will result from the collision , but also connotes the heavy impact on human lives . however , the film simply fails on that note . the effects are worn - out , the substandard screenplay limited the acting , and the director continued her sad run in terms of good - film - making credentials . she ' s still making good money though . t ? a leoni ' s unfortunate character , the news reporter , is the foundation of the story and of the cast . but the film suffers from too many characters that do not need to be explored . robert duvall ' s aging astronaut is lifeless , and morgan freeman ' s president is restricted to , well , a righteous president ( which means he ' s not interesting at all ) . leoni ' s character is the only appealing one , and is played with reasonable conviction ( but a rather peculiar showing when reporting for msnbc ) , but was definitely undervalued by the director and screenwriters . warning : spoilers included ( but a lot of it is irrelevant and predictable anyway ) . plot holes , plot holes , plot holes . now , e . l . e . is threatening to exterminate more than 99 % of the human race , and they send eight puny little nuclear bombs up there ? where ' s the logic ? leder could have at least made it plausible with 20 . and then it turns out that only a few percent of the world population actually perish , and those less selfish ones ( the ones that stayed at home ) were the victims . the film was almost mocking them , telling them they had died for nothing . i also fail to see how two teenagers , carrying a baby , would be the first to climb up the mountain / hill , even with a motorbike for a head - start . it ' s unlikely that the dust will take just two years to settle , but that doesn ' t really matter . building caves was a strategy mentioned in ` dr . strangelove ' , which proposed that people lived underground for one hundred or so years . now that is a more practical use for caves . what is the point of living in caves ? there is no , unlike ` dr . strangelove ' , any radioactivity outside to restrict exposure . how do plants grow ? if humans have the technology to keep plants alive in caves , there ' s no reason why they can ' t do it in the open . the president disclosed that other countries have been preparing their own caves . obviously this means that the other countries were informed a long time ago , and you can ' t be serious to say that nobody leaked the news to the media . in an important mission like that of the ` messiah ' , for that matter any mission , it is impossible that isn ' t sufficient fuel for an extra couple of hundred metres , needless to say tens of kilometres . this is not deep impact ? it ' s a frivolous cheap impact . but even with all that , some overacting , and a 3 . 4 rating , it ' s still watchable , just don ' t think about it . okay ?\",\n",

ideas about how unseen forces work to deceive and control the public . a little imagination goes a long way . in richard donner \\' s conspiracy theory , jerry fletcher ( mel gibson ) is a new york city cab driver who seems to have a conspiracy theory about everything . his latest , that nasa is trying to kill the president by causing an earthquake from the space shuttle , might sound outrageous to us , but is all in a day \\' s work for him . he combs the newspaper , looking for tidbits that leave telltale warnings about the goings - on behind the scenes , and from there jerry draws his conclusions . upstanding citizen that he is , he tries to convince alice sutton ( julia roberts ) of the justice department that the president must be warned . lucky gal , alice , who met jerry when he saved her from a couple of muggers and has had to listen to his theories during the six months since . what she doesn \\' t know is that jerry \\' s interest in her is far more than , well , professional . he goes to great lengths to follow her around and watch her in her own apartment . but when some secret government types seem to take an interest in jerry \\' s ideas and his limited - circulation \" conspiracy theory \" newsletter , he finds himself in danger and in real need of alice \\' s help . one of the problems with conspiracy theory is that it tries to pass itself off as an action - thriller when it seems to have neither a whole lot of action , nor a significant number of thrills . part of this is a result of the film \\' s slow pace . it takes forever to set up the relationship between jerry and alice , and even once that is over with , the rest of the film seems to be a lot of boredom that every once in a while stops to take a break for excitement . at over two hours , this film could have been significantly condensed and had it \\' s running time shortened by twenty minutes to half an hour , but even then , the action scenes would not be able to save the film . instead of truly exciting and engaging set pieces , we \\' re treated to a few of the generic scenes with the requisite \" black elements \" : black helicopter , men in black action suits and body armor , black vehicles - you know the drill . they come on down with all kinds of neat gadgets and weapons , but for some reason a guy with just a bunch of theories and some chick with no training somehow manage to elude them every time . big deal , we \\' ve seen it all before . watching the film , i wished donner had at least tried to use a little imagination , but i was out of luck . now , when i say it took forever to set up the \" relationship \" between jerry and alice , i completely mean what one person is relative to the other , and not romantic involvement . oh , donner and screenwriter brian helgeland would like you to believe that by the end of the movie , the two main characters will end up falling hopelessly in love with each other , but there seems to be no evidence of that ever occurring . you see , there were more sparks between gibson and danny glover in the lethal weapon movies ( also directed by donner ) than between gibson and roberts in conspiracy theory . the two just don \\' t click , and when you throw in a number of happenings that would cause alice to reject jerry altogether ( like finding out he \\' s been stalking her ) , the subsequent attraction is absolutely forced . the script in general also seems forced , like someone sat helgeland down and forced him to write it , then took it and forced it upon us . dialog is undistinguished and rather unmemorable , to the point that i almost stopped listening . even gibson \\' s usual gift for ad lib couldn \\' t punch up the film sufficiently to raise my interest , although one of jerry \\' s theories about oliver stone was mildly amusing . unfortunately , much of what \\' s discussed in the film is not inherently important to what \\' s going on , but instead filler that starts out with potential , but ends up just being extraneous because it \\' s never followed through . for example , jerry professes that a man found drowned in his swimming pool was actually murdered by the government in a new york subway station . he even goes so far as to explain that the station was flooded at the time due to a water main break ( hence the water in a subway station ) , and that the coroner should check the man \\' s lungs for chlorine . this is convincing enough to alice that she seems to believe him . you know what happens then ? nothing , zip , nada . no follow - up whatsoever , so what \\' s the significance ? okay , here \\' s another one . a couple of well known ( real life ) assassins were found to have possessed copies of the j . d . salinger novel \" the catcher in the rye \" . jerry also has a bunch of copies . whenever he goes into a bookstore , he has to buy one . leaving out the question of whether or not this makes jerry an assassin , we \\' re never given a reason to believe why this would make him an assassin . not when we find out about his salinger collection , not when he goes to the bookstore , not later on when we get the answer to our first question . the point becomes totally extraneous . oh , did i mention that patrick stewart is in this film ? yeah , he plays this government psychiatrist named dr . jonas who may or may not be a bad guy . that \\' s about it . for all the presence this usually marvelous actor has , he \\' s nearly forgettable in conspiracy theory . you can just lump him in with the supporting players , with the exception of cylk cozart who plays agent lowry of the fbi . this guy was really likable , and i wish he and his character had gotten more screen time . okay , here \\' s my theory . this really started out as a great film , but some of its jokes were actually true ! the government came in and forced donner to make edits for the sake of national security , and this was what was left over .',\n",

' halloween ' will be like ' psycho ' and still be extremely popular even almost 40 years later . i just hope someday ' halloween ' will be released in a new dolby soundtrack with the 4 extra scenes on the dvd edition . ' halloween ' isn ' t just another slice - and - dice horror flick , it ' s an intelligent , horrifying and best film experience ever made . see ' halloween ' and be scared . . . . then watch it again ! reviewed by brandon herring october 7 , 1999 .\",\n",

s : we - lei becomes absorbed in his career , indulges in an affair with a co - worker ; jia - li feels restless and trapped , bound by a choice she made while young , but which no longer seems wise . the film never redeems these clich ? s by conveying the feel of authentic experience , the intensity of lived pain , and much of it seems trite and belaboured . it unfolds , awkwardly , as a series of flashbacks , told during a luncheon in vienna , where jia - li meets her brother \\' s old flame ( teresa hu ) , now a concert pianist , whom she has not seen since college . both women seem rather sad , and resigned to their sadness . their circumstances ( and those of jia - li \\' s brother and a college friend ) suggest not so much that they have made the wrong choices -- married the wrong man , chosen the wrong career path , etc . -- but rather that the choices available to them were inadequate . it is not that jia - li married the wrong man ; she didn \\' t . the problem is that she needed to marry at all -- and that if she did not marry , she would still be just as unhappy . for a woman in modern taiwan , that day tells us , the cards are stacked , the dice are loaded : she can play the game , but the house always wins . the film \\' s sympathetic feminist implications are presumably the reason it caused such controversy upon its release in taiwan . seen now , it does not seem provocative . indeed , it \\' s hard to imagine anyone having felt passionate enough about the film to generate any controversy : it may be ambitious , it may be innovative , but it is also terribly , terribly dull . and what was new for taiwan was not necessarily new for the rest of us : yang adopts methods established years before by antonioni and others , and his use of those methods is fumbling , uncertain , undisciplined . nor does he bring anything new -- other than the locale -- to the material . there are moments when that day takes on some of the emotional richness it strives for -- in a young couple \\' s first kiss , in the awkward meeting of a woman and her husband \\' s mistress -- but they are brief . too often , yang devotes needless time to mundane scenes -- grocery shopping , flower - arranging -- in which nothing happens , little is said , no emotion imparted . perhaps , if the film were content to focus on such reflective , inward moments , leaving us to guess at thoughts and feelings , it might have been ambiguous , suggestive , insinuating . but jia - li and her disaffected companions do not only brood in silence : they talk about their problems , at length , in detail , redundantly , and eliminate all subtleties . at two hours and forty - five minutes , it all seems exorbitantly long , indulgently long - winded . consider the defining moment for jia - li , the titular day on the beach . the thrust of the whole film explains , easily enough , what we are to think of that moment , what it means when she walks away from a particular situation . even so , the film has not one but two characters explain it for us verbally , in case we may have missed the point . needless time is devoted to expressing what should have remained unexpressed , and that is the problem throughout . the look of the film is as tedious as the drawn - out narrative . it was the first feature shot by christopher doyle -- at least , it \\' s his name in the credits -- who is now rightly regarded as one of the world \\' s leading cinematographers . in the freewheeling expressionism of his work with directors like chen kaige and wong kar - wai , he seems incapable of fashioning a boring image . you would never know it from watching that day , which , due either to doyle \\' s inexperience or yang \\' s humdrum direction , is almost perverse in its insistence on making the physical environment seem as drab and banal as possible . in scrutinizing the long decay of a marriage , that day manages to capture the ennui of the experience , but none of the damage , none of the heartbreak .',\n",

( so the big question is when does hitchcock make his obligatory walk - on ? at 37 minutes into the film , he leaves a train station carrying a large musical instrument case . don \\' t miss it . ) in the second half the story finally comes alive when it gets into the courtroom . the great master shows his hand there as the tensions build as rapidly in the second part as they lay fallow in the first . watch how the camera angles are sometimes from the back and other times from way on high to set the exact tone for the trial \\' s action . as anthony explains it , the simple case has only 3 possibilities : mr . paradine poisoned himself , mrs . paradine did it , or the valet did it . the end includes many devastating revelations and some nice twists so it is too bad the first half is so languid . the paradine case runs 1 : 53 . the picture is in black and white . it is not rated but would be pg for mature themes and would be fine for kids around nine and up if they are interested .',\n",

\" 54 \" belongs in the elite group of films known as \" the big disappointments \" : the films that attain so much hype and / or so much potential in its creation that they come off worse than they are when they are finally finished . i was heavily awaiting \" 54 , \" not the least because i \\' ve become fascinated with the infamous club , which has been the subject of an engrossing documentary that \\' s been running all summer on vh1 , which is , weirdly enough , much more intriguing and engrossing than this \" edgy \" film . perhaps more importantly , \" 54 \" is part of the blossoming subgenre , \" the 70s nostalgia film , \" which has been picking up mighty steam , what with \" boogie nights \" and \" the last days of disco \" coming out within the year , and both being such damn good movies that not only captured the feel of a certain time period ( the late 70s party and the early 80s wakeup period ) , but brought us interesting and real characters , like scotty , the tragically gay boom mike operator from \" boogie nights , \" and charlotte , the ironically clueless and bitchy co - protagonist from \" the last days of disco , \" not to mention several others . \" 54 \" deals not so much with the timeline of the studio ( how it began , how it was run , how it ended ) - that \\' s all dealt with in the narrated opening and finale - but more interested in the characters who populated it . this is a definite plus . here \\' s a film that could have been a fascinating 2 hour plus film about the tragic people who went there to party , and had to wakeup in the 80s when things like diseases , economy problems , and perhaps worst of all , reagan , all hit and forced everyone into a rude awakening . the story of the studio is tragedy in itself : let \\' s look at how it all affected the people . but this film doesn \\' t let that happen . it gives us a half - assed protagonist named shane o \\' shea ( ryan phillippe , from \" i know what you did last summer \" ) , who \\' s chief character trait is the fact that he \\' s from new jersey , which also happens to be his chief character flaw ( i guess ) . he \\' s dim - witted , into being part of \" the scene , \" and soon finds he \\' s become a bit of a rave amongst the studio regulars . . . a bit like \" saturday night fever , \" \\' cept no travolta and no real interest put into him . poor , poor phillippe struggles to make him interesting , but all he is a half - assed character and not at all our ticket to the glimpse of the decadence going on inside the club that he could have been . shane begins to hang out with some other denizens of the club , like anita ( salma hayek ) , a wannabe donna sommers , and her young hubby , greg randanzo ( breckin meyer , from \" clueless \" ) , who helps shane become a bartender and rise to a bit of fame . although he begins to get somewhere when he sleeps with the foxy billie auster ( sela ward ) , an exec of sorts , he falls in lust with a soap star named julie black ( neve campbell ) , and thus the boring romance subplot that \\' s all too not necessarily important to anything else in the film and never really becomes interesting at any point in the film . the film \\' s sole point of interest and one major strongpoint is the all - too necesary personage of steve rubell , played by mike myers ( you heard me ) . rubell , the famous head of the studio acted as if he never stopped partying ever , and is an easy metaphor for the life and times of his creation , but the film , thanks to a surprisingly strong performance by myers , makes him out to be more than that . notice the scenes sole shocking scene , where he tries to get felatio from one of his male employees in turn for a promotion : myers brings the humanity to rubell in this scene , and a couple others , that some of us who \\' ve only seen him on tv never saw , and proves to be perhaps the one aspect of studio 54 that this film actually nails . first time feature director mark christopher proves that he \\' s a better director than a writer , though not too terribly much . his story is trite and shallow , as are his characters , and his direction is shockingly flat , especially for a film about this subject . it \\' s as if he had a great story to tell , but instead opted for the easier route . the studio \\' s recreation is amazingly accurate , though , and very impressive , but his direction is never captivating enough . some people say that a film does its job if it makes you want to visit the locale it takes place in ( despite the film \\' s tone , i still want to go to rome and its many nightclubs after i saw fellini \\' s \" la dolce vita \" ) , and when i watched \" 54 , \" i didn \\' t particularly want to stay .',\n",

ve humanist tale of improbable hope . a hapless rock group write a song about bubby and sing it for him and so give him the gift of community . he returns the favour when he steps on stage one night and becomes their frontman , turning the fragmented impressions of his experiences into performance art , and turning the band into a popular draw . innocence triumphs . bubby becomes a holy fool , an idiot savant , and graces us with wisdom . it \\' s a strange turn of events , but by now we shouldn \\' t be surprised , because bad boy bubby ain \\' t like other movies .',\n",

( \" all i \\' ve ever known to be true is a lie , \" moses complains . ) after finding out his real identity , he sees for the first time the oppression of the jewish slaves that are all around him . after leaving egypt , moses comes back to ask ramses to let moses \\' s people go . this leads to the classic scene of the parting of the red sea , which is one of many places where computers were used to enhance the traditionally hand - drawn animation of the most of the production . it is the absolutely stunning visuals that make the movie so compelling . drawn with a rich palette of luxurious roses , blues and golds , the picture looks sumptuous from its first frame to its last . the construction of the temple is shown in blowing dust , and other scenes are shot with the glow of a rising sun . the most original visual sequence in the film occurs during a dream moses has . done with an explicit two - dimensional look , the colorful images painted on the temple walls come to life to tell their own animated story . even though it has its weaknesses , the prince of egypt is a noble attempt to carve out a new genre -- serious animated movies for adults that are acceptable for the entire family . this awe - inspiring movie deserves to be seen . the prince of egypt runs about 1 : 30 . it is rated pg for thematic elements and would be fine for the whole family . how old a kid would need to be to be interested depends on the child , but those over 8 will probably like it .',\n",

( i \\' ve never understood the reasoning behind this tactic , since good notices have never been key to the success of movies like the crow . ) so much for any confidence in the worthiness of their followup . this time , ashe ( french - accented actor vincent perez ) is retrieved from his watery death ( he and his young son were shackled together , shot , and then thrown off a pier ) by the crow who serves as his link between the worlds of the living and the dead . perez might have some screen presence if he \\' s given something to do with himself , but here he \\' s simply thrown in front of the camera as a pretty face . at first , he \\' s shivery and frightened , but he quickly recovers from the shock of his own death and becomes a badass biker from beyond the grave . he \\' s befriended by sarah ( mia kirshner ) , presumably an older version of the child who narrated the first film . kirshner , so beguiling in exotica , is here an exquisitely photographed blank . tattooed with angels \\' wings , sarah is just about as lovely as women come , but she serves no purpose , not even as seductress . the gang of punks who killed ashe are ostensibly commanded by judah ( richard brooks ) , but a far more interesting choice as leader would have been iggy pop , who plays a gaunt fellow named curve . iggy , all bones , veins , and drawl , is the only one who seems to have shared in the aesthetic of ruin that defines this film . like all good things here , he \\' s dispatched too soon and without much imagination . in the meantime , we \\' re subjected to tedious glimpses of judah \\' s compound , where bondage is the order of the day and hot wax is poured over naked bodies in s & m fantasies that would seem shy of the cutting edge even if they weren \\' t distinctly secondhand . even the soundtrack is tired . more than anything i \\' ve seen from hollywood lately , city of angels smacks baldly of product -- it \\' s a movie with a lousy script but a great look . critics have been quick to fault the direction of mtv veteran tim pope , but his work isn \\' t that bad per se . he \\' s got a good eye , and some intriguing visual ideas -- if anything , this movie has a few too many scenes of ridiculously striking imagery . his major stylistic failing is that he can \\' t seem to direct an action scene , and the quick , nonsensical cutting that ensues is reminiscent of a low budget kung fu movie . but as director , he must also shoulder the blame for the little screenplay that wasn \\' t , the performers who couldn \\' t , and an apparent lack of ideas on the parts of everyone involved . who bought david s . goyer \\' s anemic script , anyway ? the producers of this crow were either too dim to realize their story was doomed to be a hollow rehash , or too cynical to figure their audience would know the difference .',\n",

              " ('in 1987 the stock market crashed , and oliver stone \\' s wall street was released to critical acclaim and packed movie houses . wall street lucked out in its timing ; the recent crash gave the film a resonation it might not of had , and though its kill - or - be - killed approach to business was exaggerated , that very ideology was keyed into the mind set of the quintessential reagan - era businessman . stone constructed his film as a mythical good vs . evil tale relayed in the fast - paced milieu of the burgeoning stock exchange . critics and audiences lauded wall street , elevating its status to that of a contemporary classic . i \\' m proud to say that i will never be counted as one of them . i found wall street to be just as axiomatic and pandering as the majority of stone \\' s output with its thin caricatures , obvious sentiments , and a charisma barren performance by the young charlie sheen . stone goes for broke in every scene ( the same could be said for nearly all of his works ) . this approach tends to bury his purported message beneath a heap of good intentions . he directs stock exchange scenes in typical hyperbolic mode with people shouting into phones as if they were in a plummeting airplane . it \\' s all an excuse for stone to ratchet up the emotion with false intensity , rather than explore what these situations are really like . i have a feeling the brokers would be psychologically manipulative ( as they are presented in boiler room ) rather than laughably over the top . these guys are salesmen after all , not televised judges . more than anything i am baffled by why so many adore wall street . the only possible solution i can muster is its release date . and not just the timeliness of the \" greed is good \" subject matter : the film was plumped down in the eighties , a decade in which the one - joke comedy rose to an art form , and a group of glamorous brat packers smirked their way through inane high concept , low result movies . in my mind , the eighties will forever be remembered as a decade with not only a proliferation of bad movies , but bad music , bad hair , and bad clothes . maybe stone \\' s after school special set in wall street was viewed as a welcome change of pace . boiler room is an equally well - timed film with some similarities to stone \\' s piece of crap . they both feature a consequential father - son relationship , though boiler room \\' s is much more subtle and touching . and they are both concerned with the power of greed , yet the men in boiler room are akin to poseurs presuming to be big shots rather than the slippery - smooth , heartless gordon gecko figures of wall street . boiler room is a message movie as well , though ( at least until the end ) doesn \\' t shove it in our faces . boiler room is about the pursuit of cash and the degrees to which people will go for that cash . as i said , this film is indeed timely in a society where who wants to be a millionaire is the number one prime time show every day ( bringing about a revolution of prime time tv watching that hasn \\' t been seen in quite a while ) ; not only do we want to be millionaires , we want to watch other people become millionaires ! in our super - judgmental , power - oriented culture the desire for money supersedes everything ; when you have money , you have it \" all \" . and seth ( giovanni ribisi ) wants it \" all \" the easy way . he \\' s a well - intentioned college drop out who gets lured into working for an illegally run brokerage firm ( the kind that sells junk stock ) whereupon he meets others just like him . ben affleck is cast as jim , the company headhunter , who struts in commanding the room like a frat boy gordon gecko . his job is to influence trainee \\' s into becoming enthusiastic employees by giving a speech that subtly attacks their man hood . it \\' s ironic that he sells these pups the same load of b . s that they \\' re told to dish out to prospective buyers . affleck \\' s character is obviously supposed to recall alec baldwin \\' s similar character in glengary glen ross , and that proves detrimental to the actor \\' s performance . affleck shouts , curses and be - littles his rookie employees just like baldwin , minus the edge . when alec played the scene he became the part , spewing those brutal lines as if they were his own . by comparison affleck simply looks as if he were doing a really hammy line reading . the brokers approach their job with the fervor of overzealous jocks : they storm to work like football players on the way to the big game . rap music thumps on the soundtrack effectively illustrating who these guys think they are : intellectual gangsters . they aren \\' t above a rumble as a test of man hood especially during leisure time where the lumbering scott caan seems all too eager to use his fists in minor disputes . we drink up this world along with seth , and watch him become seduced by it , just like we might be . as in all cautionary tales , boiler room begins with seducing us into its illustrious world of profit and wrongdoing , then smacks us with the consequences of all the recklessness . i know this story . we all do . but it can work if it \\' s told with intelligence and energy , and that is how writer \\\\ director ben younger tells it . as a director of ( please excuse my french ) mise - en - scene younger has much to learn . his style is sitcom bland . but his writing isn \\' t . younger \\' s script is well studied in the vernacular of this bunch ; his dialogue is like a junior david mamet . despite the moderate camera work younger fills his phone - pitch scenes with tension that comes from just the performances and the tightly wound script . the brokers \\\\ hucksters counter every customer objection , gently bullying them into buying stock . these moments are filmed like psychological action scenes : a tense confrontation between a victimizer and a victim who isn \\' t aware that he is one . with the exception of affleck \\' s brief appearances , the performances are truly exceptional . ribisi , who has the edgy looks of a character actor , is extremely potent here , working his pale angular face , and eerie , plaintive stare for all their worth . he conveys child - like vulnerability ( his character seems to hide in a corner whenever things aren \\' t going his way ) in some scenes , and in others he \\' s ferociously cut throat . the jekyll and hyde contradiction works well in the movie : ribisi is confident when it \\' s just him and the phone , but cowardly in front of authority figures including his abrasive father ( authoritatively played by ron rifkin ) . boiler room thankfully avoids wall street - like histrionics in the sales - pitch sequences ; the sales build slowly like a crescendo of intelligent psychological ploys . those ploys are taught to seth by chris ( vin diesel ) , a kind broker who alternates between seth \\' s friend and his mentor . diesl shines in his minor role . this week i saw the sci - fi opus pitch black in which diesel plays a completely different role in an equally effective manner . in that film he has the kind of role that might have gone to arnold schwarzenegger in the 80 \\' s , and in boiler room he has the kind of role that might have gone to elliot gould in the 70 \\' s . nicky katt is also memorable as a superior broker obsessed with what he can \\' t have . nia long , as the firm \\' s secretary , ( a lone black women amongst many white men ) is ribisi \\' s love interest in a part that at first looks to be as insignificant as most of the parts this talented actress gets , but develops into something more interesting . the two make an oddly likeable couple . long is smart and brash , and ribisi is charmingly aloof . at one point he says to her \" i \\' m just lookin \\' for some chocolate love \" . it \\' s a terrible line but ribisi delivers it in such an innocuous child - like way , it becomes sweetly endearing . unfortunately , towards the end , the boiler room turns a tad schmaltzy . there is much crying , hugging , and sorrowful stares . this is okay when taken in small doses , but younger \\' s conclusion is constructed as a series of these boo - hoo moments , one following the other . a particular misstep is his attempt to show the effect that seth \\' s manipulations have on one of his poor victims . it \\' s not a bad idea but the execution is lacking , with those scenes feeling tacked on to further spell out the message . that message being , \" greed is bad \" . yes it \\' s patently obvious , but boiler room conveys it by introducing us to a culture that i haven \\' t seen much of in the movies : the disenfranchised twenty something entrepreneur . and all wall street did was introduce us to a simplistic fantasy world of saints and sinners . boiler room offers neither extreme . it gives us what is in between , and for that i am thankful .',\n",

( from what i know of harris , he , like pollock , was not born gifted or lucky ; instead , a strong work ethic is the seed of his success . ) granted , it \\' s possible that _pollock_ will alienate those same viewers perplexed by the imponderable \" purpose \" of pollock \\' s splatter series : the common thread between them is a lack of editorializing . the movie _pollock_ is all purposeful gazes and silent exchanges dotted by tantrums , but the motivations are left to our own perceptions . and it is a sympathetic yet not altogether forgiving film , as illustrated by a disheartening conclusion . _pollock_ encapsulates the period in which he fought a losing battle against personal demons ( alcoholism , depression , and the general attendant miseries of an artist ) while finding a place of subconscious expression . a brief introduction to pollock \\' s raging drunk side segues into his getting accosted by a fellow new york artist , lee krasner ( marcia gay harden , awarded a best supporting actress oscar for this brilliant portrayal ) , who works from the outside - in , pre - intellectualizing every stroke of her brush . in a scene after they have moved in together and established adjoining studios , she asks what he hopes to achieve on his latest canvas , grilling him about the interplay of cubism and surrealism until he says , \" you paint the fucking thing , \" and leaves in a huff . by the time they wed , she has become his de facto manager ; it is form marrying function and chaos marrying discipline , a most harmonious collision . ( krasner denies him a baby , indicating that it would upset the balance . ) such a union is destined to implode , and i hope i \\' m not ruining the _pollock_ experience by saying that it does . while it is never depicted as a very romantic matrimony to start -- pollock and wife channel their passions elsewhere -- their symbiosis leaves each other picked dry after several years , and it comes down to krasner suffering one of pollock \\' s conniptions too many : \" you are killing me ! you are killing me ! you are killing me ! \" ( aside : harris \\' own wife , amy madigan , is unrecognizable and exceptional as gallery diva peggy guggenheim . ) pollock himself moves on to dalliances with younger women like ruth klingman ( the scorching jennifer connelly ) , hoping , one supposes , to catch the revitalizing whiff of youth . i love jackson pollock \\' s stuff and i am enamoured of harris \\' _pollock_ as well . it \\' s scrappy and observant ; no coincidence that its minor failings are the occasional invasive flourish , such as jeff beal \\' s hummable but no less lamentable score -- i can \\' t imagine that pollock , or anyone , would paint to this music , which puts filling soundtrack voids ahead of complementing the images . one of my favourite sequences is an eerily quiet re - enactment of hans namuth shooting that famous pollock footage in east hampton , long island ; the mounting tension is almost comic , as namuth keeps interrupting pollock \\' s process to reload his camera or take a dinner break . a more seasoned director might \\' ve been too arrogant to admit that not all artists or mediums are created equal .',\n",

( smart was convicted and given a life sentence for her part in the murder of her husband . ) smart \\' s got a point . it wouldn \\' t be the first time that the public took the better scripted and well - acted movie version of an event as the absolute truth over the duller and far less artistic real life version . however , given a choice between the mass media \\' happening \\' of the real event and the fictionalized movie , i would definitely opt for the later . real murderers rarely have dialogue as witty as what buck henry has written for this movie and smart , while pretty and alluring , is no match for the cinematic charms of nicole kidman . to die for begins in a town called little hope , new hampshire , the archetypal dry and intellectually barren american suburb . the story concerns the ambitious suzanne stone and how she tackles the obstacles between her and her life long ambition of being \\' on tv . \\' of course , one of those little obstacles turns out to be her dull and unambitious husband larry , played by matt dillon . but , with a little imagination , some charm and raw sex appeal and a rather novel approach to junior achievement , our heroine manages to overcome the nay - sayers in her life , at least temporarily . kidman triumphs in the trashy role of suzanne . i have never really been all that fond of this actress but she shows a wonderful flair for comedy in this picture . her portrayal of the incredibly shallow and dumb femme fatale resonates . kidman knows a star - making role when she sees it and she plays the conscience - deprived suzanne as the ultimate career driven , post - feminist uber - temptress from hell . she is ably abetted by wonderfully demented comic dialogue , which kidman delivers in a unselfconsciously funny way . at one point suzanne is expounding on her knowledge of world events to her future husband and sister - in - law . \" you know , \" she knowingly exclaims , \" gorbachev would still be the leader of russia or whatever , if he had just had that ugly purplish thing removed from his head . \" her husband beams at suzanne \\' s profound knowledge of world politics and then proudly proclaims that this qualifies her to be the next barbara walters . this is very close to pop culture bashing heaven , folks . the other standout performance in the film is delivered by joaquin phoenix . he plays jimmy , a burned out teenager who becomes addicted to suzanne \\' s sexual favors . kidman \\' s character , vapid though she is , is a sort of suave beacon of success to jimmy and his lost friends russell and lydia , winningly portrayed by casey affleck and alison folland . phoenix looks like the very embodiment of gen - x slackerhood ( as envisioned by tabloid tv , of course ) . his jimmy has the dead eyes and demeanor of a kid who knows that he ain \\' t going anywhere , ever . phoenix reacts to the sexy suzanne with a sort of obsessed amazement and he makes us believe that a loser character like jimmy really would be willing to kill for someone like suzanne , someone who actually noticed him . gus van sant ( drugstore cowboy , my own private idaho ) direction is first - rate . he keeps the pacing in this not - quite - thriller snapping along . van sant rightly keeps the focus of this movie on the amoral suzanne and doesn \\' t stop to proselytize the audience about the rightness or wrongness of her actions . van sant trusts his material and trusts his audience to \\' get it \\' without stopping to explain what is funny about this all - american story . the screenplay , by buck henry , is absolutely great and includes some of the best bleakly comic lines i \\' ve heard since heathers . henry \\' s story is a blast against the shallowness of the american media and the mindlessness of fame , yet the screenplay delivers this sharp message by focusing on just a few characters . henry ably manages to avoid diluting his story by aiming at too many targets and the result is a crisp and funny mini - classic . danny elfman did the original music for this movie and he delivers another eccentric , loopy score that strongly echoes his themes for edward scissorhands . either film score would make wonderful background music for halloween trick - or - treat parties . all - in - all , a wonderful production , well worth your seven bucks ! to die for : a columbia pictures release directed by gus van sant . written by buck henry score by danny elfman starring nicole kidman , matt dillon , joachin phoenix based on the book by joyce maynard . rated r - for language and mature themes .

              " (\"the saint was actually a little better than i expected it to be , in some ways . in this theatrical remake of the television series the saint , and its series sequel the return of the saint , val kilmer plays simon templar , an elusive thief who makes a living by stealing things from others for others . this movie closely resembles a james bond flick . it has the classic bond symbols : a man who can do just about anything and get away with it , a woman whom the man persues , a villain out to achieve something for himself who kills anyone to reach this goal . kilmer actually provides a rather good role in this movie , although at times you are left to ponder how he actually gets out of the many tight situations . the movie begins in his childhood in a strict school run by catholic priests . as a young boy , kilmer ' s character enjoyed magic and would often journey away from his schoolwork . that is until his school teacher finds him reading a book and demands that the young boy proclaim his name , that of a catholic saint . he refuses to do so and instead announces who he wishes to be . this leads to a devestating mistake , which is something that will stay in his mind throughout his life . kilmer ' s first mission that we are shown is to steal a microchip from ivan tretiak , played by rade serbedzija . during a press conference , he must make his way into a heavily guarded vault area , avoiding guards , cameras , and many other potential obstacles . once his mission is completed and he is safely home , the fee is paid . when he logs into his bank account and finds that he is only a few million dollars short of $ 50 million , he decides to carry out only one more mission , then retire . dr . emma russell , portrayed by elisabeth shue , has discovered a way to produce energy by way of cold fusion . this new advancement would change the world and save thousands of lives in the areas of russia , where millions are without heat and are freezing to death . the only problem is , tretiak would like to have this for himself and use it to gain power amongst the people . this presents the option for kilmer to achieve his goal . tretiak hires him to steal the equations , small pieces of paper , from shue . one of the enjoyable features in the film is the disguises that kilmer dawns to complete his missions . they are very convincing , not only to the characters in the movie , but to us . kilmer utilizes one such disguise to lure shue ' s character into getting to know him even more , which would provide him a means of stealing the energy formula . when the two meet , and end up having a sensual experience , kilmer ' s character is seemingly falling in love with emma russell , as she is falling in love with kilmer ' s alter - ego , a traveling artist . yet , he must reach his goal of $ 50 million , which requires him to steal the energy formula , putting his feelings aside . shue ' s character is eventually able to track down simon templar by putting the pieces ( the names of the catholic saints ) together , something no one else is able to do . when she finds him , they are left to team up and reclaim the energy formulas from tretiak . the saint is very action - packed , with few slow points . the sound was very well done and added to the many intense moments . along the course of the movie , there are even a few , although brief moments of comedy . these moments are almost always thanks to kilmer ' s extraneous , very convincing disguises and personalities . all in all , a rather enjoyable movie with nearly non - stop action .\",\n",

              " ('i am starting to write this review before going to see strawberry and chocolate , cuba \\' s oscar nominee for best foreign film , directed by tomas gutierrez alea ( who also directed the sometimes and in some circles critically acclaimed memorias del subdesarrollo -- \" memories of underdevelopment \" . i saw memorias as part of a cuban cinema class back in the late \\' 70s ; it merged the politics of the cuban revolution with mundane elements of the human condition . i knew then that memorias was probably a state - sanctioned political missive , and now expect strawberry will follow suit . fellow internetters , primarily in the newsgroup dedicated to cuba ( soc . culture . cuba ) , have mentioned that strawberry is a harsh criticism of the revolution and its current state of affairs . i have jumped to the conclusion that strawberry is nothing more than a veiled attempt at espousing the party line -- it probably looks like political criticism , but it ain \\' t so . having some first hand and extensive anecdotal knowledge of castro \\' s repressiveness , i can \\' t conceive of his tolerating honest and adversarial criticism of the revolution , and i can \\' t imagine his letting anyone even suggest his failure as a leader of a failed movement . as kids say these days , duh ! , the revolution \\' s current state needs no criticism ; its physical and spiritual crumbling is self evident . the proper questions to put relate to castro \\' s legitimacy . i bet the film takes castro \\' s power for granted , and that this or any other movie , produced under cuba \\' s state control , cannot question his right to run cuba \\' s political show ( ongoing now for more than 36 years ) . that \\' s why i just can \\' t believe strawberry is an honest criticism of the regime . let \\' s see what happens after the room goes dark and the screen lights up . i saw the film -- twice . i was right ; castro remained intact . strawberry negotiates the relationship between a young \" dialectic materialist , \" as he describes himself , and a homosexual photographer ( diego ) in 1979 cuba . the young man ( david ) is the son of peasants ; a symbol of the revolution \\' s reason for being . grateful to the revolution for the opportunity to receive a university education , he studies political science instead of literature , his avocation , because he perceives it is his duty . therein lies a likely unintended irony , since cuba has no need for political theoreticians . cuba \\' s government is castro . diego \\' s lifestyle is the antithesis of revolutionary life . he enjoys the finer things -- tea , opera , art . he does not do \" voluntary work \" for the revolution . his small apartment is a sensual oasis . the moniker \" bourgeois \" figuratively hangs over his head during the early parts of the movie . however , he is a \" revolucionario \" in his own way . the supporting roles are filled by : an aging busybody with a heart of gold and a troubled psyche ; david \\' s roommate , who rally takes the communist party line to its expected extreme ; david \\' s ex - girlfriend , who dumped him for another guy , yet wants to bed him before she leaves for italy with her husband ; german , a gay sculptor whose work diego is attempting to exhibit , and who strikes a faustian pact with the government . gutierrez alea and co - director juan carlos tabio do a fine job at almost showing that homosexuals can be revolutionaries too . heck , towards the end of the film you begin to think the guy deserves a medal for his patriotic fervor . he really loves the revolution ( as supposedly does everybody else in cuba ) and wants to make it better by exposing and correcting some of its flaws . real criticism is missing though . this movie is political window dressing . luis aguilar leon \\' s op . ed . piece on fresa in the miami herald ( 10 march 1995 , at 21a ) did not color my judgment ; it presaged my intuition . aguilar leon expressed my sentiment about this film \\' s political angle best : like many artistic manifestations in cuba , strawberry and chocolate sprang from a totally manipulated environment . as art critic ivan de la nuez well states in the latest issue of the magazine postmodern notes , the silenced artists are those who refuse to accept \" the charade in which artists can provoke up to a point , while the institutions legitimize themselves by forbidding them to go beyond that point . \" although terrible propaganda , this is otherwise a fine film .',\n",

              " ('some critics , including siskel & ebert , are on the record stating that martin scorsese \\' s raging bull , the story of boxer jake la motta , is the best film of the \\' 80s . since there are still a number of \\' 80s films that i haven \\' t seen , i don \\' t feel qualified to make such a judgment , but i \\' ll say this without hesitation : raging bull is a great motion picture , and i would be surprised if more than a handful of films released between january 1 , 1980 and december 31 , 1989 come close to its level . bio - pics often fall into one of two categories : overblown hero - worship or a dry , dull textbook account . it \\' s rare that a movie with the moniker \" based on the life of ? \" comes across as anything more than sporadically energetic and marginally entertaining . raging bull is the perfect counterexample , and a brilliant argument for film makers to continue to work in this genre . the picture takes the life of boxer jake la motta , a middleweight icon from the \\' 40s and \\' 50s , and develops one of the most compelling character studies ever to reach the big screen . for all 129 minutes , director martin scorsese and actor robert de niro ( in the title role ) have us mesmerized by this individual who is by turns sympathetic , sad , and horrifying . historically , raging bull is said to be mostly accurately , with the lion \\' s share of the details culled from la motta \\' s own autobiography ( which was co - written with joseph carter and peter savage ) . however , although la motta is credited as the movie \\' s \" consultant , \" he was reportedly unhappy with the final result , because it portrays him as nothing short of an uncouth , insensitive lout . the la motta of the movie is a man of extreme appetites who is driven by base , bestial impulses ? paranoia , jealousy , and blind rage . sex and violence are inextricably linked . the title is apt ? la motta is a raging bull . in the ring , he is a terror , not just beating his opponents , but destroying them . outside of it , he is no less vicious or more easily controlled . the two people who spar with him on life \\' s canvas are his wife , vicki ( cathy moriarty ) , and his brother / manager , joey ( joe pesci ) . these are the two who mean the most to jake , and who , as a result of his inability to trust himself or others , he loses . he beats vicki mercilessly because he suspects her of infidelity , and , when he inaccurately believes that his brother betrayed him , his lets loose with an explosion of violence . raging bull opens in 1941 when la motta , an up - and - coming fighter , is battling his way into the upper echelon of the middleweight class . over the years , he wins several key bouts , including one against his arch - rival , sugar ray robinson ( johnny barnes ) , but his unwillingness to capitulate with the local godfather keeps him from an opportunity to participate in a championship match . meanwhile , away from the ring , la motta falls in love with 15 - year old vicki , who he marries after discarding his shrewish first wife . vicki becomes jake \\' s greatest prize ( a wife , in his view , is not a companion , but a possession ) and the source of his most extreme pain . his own insecurity is so great that he cannot accept that a woman as beautiful as vicki could be faithful to him . hence , he is constantly haunted by a belief that she is sleeping with someone else ? perhaps even his brother . ( this leads to the famous line parodied in waiting for guffman and elsewhere : \" are you f * * king my wife ? ? ? \" ) in the late \\' 40s , la motta gets his first shot at a championship fight , but with one huge condition : he must take a fall . he does it so badly that an investigation is launched and he is almost thrown out of boxing . two years later , he wins the championship , only to lose it in a subsequent bout to sugar ray . by the late \\' 50s and early \\' 60s , when the film ends , jake has become a pathetic figure ? a broke , overweight loser who has spent time in jail for corrupting the morals of a minor , has lost his wife and children , and is trying to earn a few bucks by doing a cheap standup routine . raging bull is the other side of rocky . sylvester stallone \\' s tale of boxing triumph was released to great critical acclaim in 1976 . it won the 1977 best picture oscar , and a sequel arrived in theaters before raging bull went into production . but , where rocky romanticizes boxing , raging bull takes a cold , unflinching look at the violence both inside and outside of the ring . while scorsese \\' s primary aim is to present a riveting deconstruction of la motta the man , he never backs away from showing the seedy , ugly underside of a sport where gambling , greed , and organized crime force fighters to throw matches to continue working . rocky shows boxing at its noblest ; raging bull shows it at its most diseased . there \\' s little i can say here that hasn \\' t already said about de niro \\' s performance . in a career that has included many fine roles , this is his most outstanding . the level of intensity de niro brings to la motta is unwavering . and , although there \\' s a lot of travis bickle ( de niro \\' s character in taxi driver ) in la motta , scorsese and de niro go to great lengths to make sure that , if we never fully sympathize with him , at least we understand the forces that drive him . this is a complete characterization and a perfect example of acting . as the younger jake , de niro is trim and fit . as the fat , older man , de niro gained 50 pounds and turned his body into a grotesque parody of its normal form . how many actors would go that far ? the best oscar statue is only one testimony to the lasting power of the performance . cathy moriarty and joe pesci both earned nominations for their supporting work ( although neither won ) . their portrayals have the same raw energy that infuses de niro \\' s . pesci , who has basically re - created the same personality in two other scorsese films ( goodfellas and casino ) , presents joey as a slightly more intelligent version of his brother . the misogyny and violence are still there , only better concealed . but , when joey snaps , as he does in one scene where he pounds on a mobster ( frank vincent ) , it \\' s startling to behold . moriarty , on the other hand , must play the temptress with virginal qualities ? the only kind of woman who would ensnare jake . later , she \\' s called upon to portray the battered wife and mother whose love has turned into fear . scorsese and cinematographer michael chapman elected to shoot the bulk of raging bull in black - and - white ( a few \" home movie \" segments are in color ) . the choice is perfect for the movie , giving raging bull a unique look in an era when a black - and - white approach is almost unheard of . ( one important recent exception , schindler \\' s list , eschewed color for some of the same reasons that raging bull did . ) in black - and - white ( especially considering scorsese \\' s choice of shots and use of slow motion ) , the violence is stark and disturbing . there \\' s no room for romanticism in the ring with inky black blood staining the canvas . during fight sequences , the director also uses a number of point - of - view shots designed to show the world , however briefly , from la motta \\' s perspective . scorsese could have chosen to end the film with la motta \\' s loss to sugar ray , where he surrendered his middleweight crown . after that , his career was all downhill . yet the director allows the film to run for thirty minutes after this pivotal moment , stretching more than a decade into la motta \\' s future . the reason is obvious : scorsese isn \\' t as interested in boxing as he is in the character . following his retirement , la motta is still as violent and volatile as ever , but he has lost the arena in which he can legally unleash those tendencies . we see the results of this beast let loose on society and how the consequences of his actions reduce him to a parody of his former self . who cannot feel a surge of pity for la motta as he quietly recites marlon brando \\' s speech from on the waterfront ? ( \" i coulda been a contenda . \" ) perhaps raging bull is indeed the best film of the \\' 80s . and , if not , it \\' s certainly perilously close to the zenith .',\n",

              " ('making a sequel to a widely beloved film is a weighty proposition indeed , especially when the first film is considered by many to be a masterpiece . when it comes to living up to expectations , a filmmaker is almost doomed to some degree of failure . for a sequel to live up to or even surpass the original \\' s greatness is very rare indeed . and whereas \" babe : pig in the city \" misses equaling the greatness of its best picture nominated predecessor babe , it is a worthy companion piece . more than that , it is a spectacular work of art that deserves to stand alone in its own right . \" babe : pig in the city \" warrants the classification of being recognized with such classics like \" the godfather : part ii \" and \" the empire strikes back \" as being one of the greatest sequels ever produced . \" babe : pig in the city \" picks up precisely where \" babe \" left off . having won the sheep herding competition , farmer hoggett ( james cromwell ) and his pig are elevated to fame status . a series of unfortunate circumstances and hilariously freakish events leads to mrs . hoggett taking babe from the small country farm into the big city . in doing so , the film transports us into a wonderfully imaginative world that simultaneously mirrors and exceeds the creative design seen in the original . \" babe : pig in the city \" flourishes where so many sequels fail . most sequels simply rehash the events of the first film . not \" babe : pig in the city \" . this is a completely original tale that offers up a story drastically different than the first . also , by not being content to utilize most of the old characters , this film gives us many new ones to enjoy . in essence , it doesn \\' t attempt to copy itself . instead , it strives to achieve an originality of its own . and it succeeds . that \\' s not to say the familiar is absent . \" babe : pig in the city \" retains some of the best core elements and characters from the first film . along with babe himself , ferdinand the duck comes along for the ride , as does mrs . hoggett ( one of this decade \\' s best and most underappreciated comic characterizations , hilariously performed by magda szubanski ) . the three singing mice also make the journey , chiming in with their cute high - pitched vocals . the story structure is also similar as each segment is introduced with title cards read by the aforementioned mice . from there , we are guided once again by roscoe lee browne \\' s soothingly deep narrative . composer nigel westlake also returns with his whimsical music style that is perfect for cinematic fables such as these . but these elements are simply the frame that surrounds an entirely new painting . while staying at the flealands hotel , babe encounters a veritable ark - full of new animals . monkeys , kittens , and dogs of various breeds and sizes are some of the new \" urbanites \" that babe befriends , as well as some wonderfully comical pelicans that ferdinand the duck happens to encounter . each character is distinctly unique , some of which are imbued with personal human - like struggles that are endearing and touching . and while this world focuses largely on these animals , we are introduced to two new human characters as well . mary stein plays the owner of the flealands hotel , an animal - loving young spinster who harbors these lost creatures much to the dismaying anger of her fellow neighbors . stein \\' s landlady is a wonderfully odd caricature . we also meet fugly floom , an old soft - spoken clown who owns many of the animals in the flealands hotel , utilizing them as a part of the act that he performs at different parties and functions . not having known who portrayed fugly floom prior to seeing the film , it came as an unexpected pleasant surprise to see who it was . so as not to ruin this well - kept secret , i won \\' t reveal the actor \\' s identity here . it was a treat indeed to see one of cinema \\' s legends grace the screen again in what was a superbly gentle and heartwarming performance . the greatest triumph of \" babe : pig in the city \" is the art direction . simply put -- it bleeds creativity , taking the look of the original film to a whole new level . restricted primarily to a farm the first time around , this second installment creates an entire city , dazzling us with unique fable - like architecture . but the stroke of pure genius by production designer roger ford is his use of our world \\' s architectural landmarks . designing a skyline that includes the statue of liberty , the sydney opera house , the brooklyn bridge , the hollywood sign and the eiffel tower , ford has created a singular city that encompasses all of our cities ( as seen in the film photo and pre - production drawing to your right ) . added to that , many of this city \\' s streets are the twin siblings of venice \\' s gondola - trekked rivers . the metropolis that has sprung from ford \\' s vision is a wondrous sight to behold . it is a world that you want to walk around in . norma moriceau \\' s costume designs belong in this world , vibrant in color and style equal to that of the ford \\' s landscape . most of the costumes are imaginatively cartoonish , with the most exotically grand design going to that of fugly floom \\' s clown outfit . andrew lesnie \\' s photography captures these elements with various lighting moods that are beautifully effective in creating the film \\' s multiple emotional tones . much press fodder has been made over the weeks leading up to the release of \" babe : pig in the city \" . reports stated that its original cut was branded with a pg - 13 rating . these reports were discovered to be false as it was assigned a pg rating . but even so , to be anything harsher than the original \\' s g rating had many parents and fans up in arms . by deleting a minimal number of shots , \" babe : pig in the city \" was eventually given the coveted g rating . although appeased , many fans were still concerned that it would be too dark , fearing that the film may have come to be possessed by tim burton himself . well , to coin a phrase , the reports of \" babe : pig in the city \" \\' s death at the hands of a dark , scary , felliniesque interpretation have been greatly exaggerated . granted it has its moments of pseudo - morbidity , but all - in - all \" babe : pig in the city \" is the funny and charming adventure that everyone was hoping it would be . whatever \" dark \" moments it may have can be attributed to director george miller ( the \" mad max \" trilogy , \" the witches of eastwick \" , \" lorenzo \\' s oil \" ) . having served as a producer and co - writer on the first film , miller moves into the director \\' s chair for this one , putting his own unique sense of style into this budding franchise . the story of \" babe : pig in the city \" is an enchanting yarn , but one that doesn \\' t achieve the emotional or character depth of the original . missing here is the attempt to broach such heady themes as personal identity , an individual \\' s worth , challenging conformity , and one \\' s purpose in life . \" babe \" dealt with this weighty subject matter , creating a timeless fable . \" babe : pig in the city \" should not have rehashed these themes , but i do wish it would have attempted to explore new ones . this film is not bereft of moral or message as it parallels such issues as urban strife , class differences , sacrificial courage , and so on . but this film \\' s goals aren \\' t as lofty as the first \\' s , instead choosing to take a more straightforward approach , allowing its themes to take a back seat to an exciting , sometimes intense , fable adventure that is undeniably clever and inventive . \" babe : pig in the city \" also decides against developing a relationship to the level of which was present in the first film , specifically the one between farmer hoggett and babe . hoggett \\' s love for babe , which grew ever so gently , is what gave that film its charming and endearing quality . best exemplified in hoggett \\' s dance for babe , this moving relationship was truly unique . it is something that i wish would have been present again ( and could have through fugly floom ) , but was not . please understand , these are not negative criticisms , per se \\' , but simply statements of what i see as the differences between \" babe : pig in the city \" being a very good film and the original being a great one . but having said that , these observations are minor critiques at best . as an overall piece , \" babe : pig in the city \" is a thoroughly enchanting and entertaining fable from beginning to end . sure , it isn \\' t a great film , but it is an excellent one that possesses elements of greatness . it is a film that is magical with its charm and humor , exciting in its adventurous exploits , funny with its dry wit and cute voices , and breathtaking in its presentation . \" babe : pig in the city \" may not be moviemaking at its absolute best , but it is on level of cinematic quality that is rarely achieved or seen in cinema . as a result , if you choose to let this film pass you by , you will be missing of the year \\' s best cinematic treats .',\n",

              " ('hollywood has really done the whole dracula thing to death ( no pun intended - honest ) . it \\' s a shame , too , because the good count was probably the most frightening out the old b - movie monsters . i mean , come on . are people really going to get that scared over a big green guy named frankenstein that moves at a speed of five miles per hour ? hell no . and not only was the idea of a vampire frightening as hell , but it also carried with it a kind of sensual feeling as well , not commonly associated with horror films . and not only has the idea been done too many times , but with the possible exception of from dusk \\' till dawn , has not been done very well lately , either . this is precisely why it was so much fun for me watching the original nosferatu . i got to go back to the times when making movies ( even horror movies ) was considered an art form , and not just done to make cash like nowadays . and that is exactly what this film is ; art . i \\' ve been a horror fan since i was eight years old , and to this day i have not seen any horror film cover the intellectual ground that this film covers . let me backtrack a minute . when i say \" intellectual ground \" , i don \\' t mean that nosferatu tackles philosophical questions or anything like that , i just mean that in order for the film to work the way it was intended to , a little bit of thinking is involved . with most modern slasher movies like friday the 13th and what - not , you can just simply sit back in your chair and be frightened by the gore that is shown . those movies could have been made by a fifth grader with a good makeup kit ; movies like this require the viewer to actually pay attention and ponder what is happening on the screen . you see , this movie has barely any violence in it and even less blood or gore . this is a thinking man \\' s slasher flick . the \" nosferatu \" of the title is orlock ( max shreck ) , a strange , hermit - like count that , as the film opens , is looking for a new home to buy . he employs the help of hutter ( gustav von wangenhein ) , a real estate salesman ( or something to that effect ) who has a nice home and even a fiancee named ellen ( greta schroeder ) . upon orders from his boss , hutter treks to the transylvanian mountains to visit orlock \\' s castle and speak to him about his new home ( which just happens to be right next door to hutter \\' s ) . the next morning , he wakes up to find teeth marks on his neck . . . not really a good sign . he then discovers through some reading that the count is a \" nosferatu \" , or vampire , one of the undead that feeds off the blood of living humans . but by the time he pieces this together , he is too late ; orlock has already embarked to hutter \\' s hometown via boat . will hutter reach his destination in time to save his fiancee from the deadly clutches of count orlock ? the character of orlock is , of course , dracula . the only only reason his name was changed was because this was an unauthorized account of bram strocker \\' s novel . just thought that was an interesting little side note . . . probably the only way you will get to see this fine film is by purchasing a copy of arrow entertainment \\' s digitally restored cut , now available in stores . however , this version is quite different than maunau \\' s original masterpiece . the movie is now sporting a new soundtrack by band type o - negative and color tinting , much like the 1984 version of lang \\' s metropolis . now , i really appreciate what arrow entertainment is trying to do here , bringing a classic like this to the attention of a wider audience that might have otherwise just skipped this one . but alas , i like watching movies the way they were originally intended to be seen . but that \\' s just my bag ; you may like the newer , more \" modern \" version better . either way , i suggest investing your money in a copy . if you like what they have done with it , pop it in the vcr and enjoy . if you \\' re like me , just do what i \\' ll do during future viewings ; turn the color all the way down on your television , hit mute , turn on some bach or mozart or whatever , dim the lights and prepare to view what is truly one of the greatest films ever made .',\n",

              " (\"in the first death wish movie , mild - mannered new york architect paul kersey , played by charles bronson , was avenging the death of his wife . in the second , he was avenging his daughter . in the third , he instigated small war in order to avenge the old friend . fourth movie , on the other hand , begins with kersey doubting the point of his violent crusades and living the quiet life with his girlfriend karen , played by kay lenz . however , since this is death wish movie , we know that sooner or later something bad is going to happen to the people kersey cares for . this time karen ' s teenage daughter dies of a crack overdose and kersey is forced to return to his old vigilante ways . kersey ' s new targets , unlike the previous movies , aren ' t the ordinary street punks but rich , heavily armed and well - connected drug dealers . even such unstoppable killing machine like kersey needs some support , and it comes from the publisher nathan white ( john p . ryan ) , determined to avenge the drug - related death of his own daughter . white ' s plan is to make kersey kill major players in two rival drug dealing organisations and thus instigate the war between them . the plan begins to take shape , but kersey ' s actions bring attention of two police detectives - reiner ( george dickerson ) and nozaki ( soon teck - oh ) . fourth ( and , unfortunately , not the final ) installment in the death wish series , will probably remembered as the typical movie of cannon group , production company responsible for some of the worst cinematic trash of the last decade . however , although some critics might argue , death wish 4 : the crackdown represents slight improvement over the death wish 3 . paul kersey , one of the most intriguing ( and potentially controversial ) characters of the 1970s , is still being dumbed down by mediocre script , and charles bronson really doesn ' t feel the need to put much effort in his acting . however , the hand of a veteran director j . lee thompson seems more capable of michael winner ' s and the action scenes seem slightly less surreal , although they still look cheap and repetitive and downright boring . there are some attempts for the movie to have a plot between the numerous scenes of violence , and one of such attempts is a potentially interesting plot twist at the end . the script even tries to fake some social conscience ( through criminally underused kay lenz ' s character ) and predates the war on drugs campaign that would inspire many hollywood products in next few years . there are even some half - hearted attempts of humour - both intentional and unintentional , like in a scene where kersey assassinates mob figures by a wine bottle - but the quality of this movie is still far away from bronson ' s 1970s classics . ( special note to x - philes : mith pilleggi , the actor who plays ad skinner in the x - files , could be seen in a small role of cannery lab foreman ) .\",\n",

nazi skinhead , a kind of person who dedicates their lives to hating anyone who \\' s not what they are , and this film wisely and miracurously pulls it off . the subject of this film is one of them , but he is worse than one of the blind followers that make up most skinhead members since he is the leader of the pack . he \\' s the one who instigates them to take a firm grip onto their rage , and then in another brilliant stroke , justifies it with political propoganda that makes eerie sense when he speaks . he \\' s so utterly convincing as a public speaker and so firm in his convictions that it comes as a shock when he actually goes through the rehabilitation process . his name is derek vinyard , and he \\' s played by edward norton with so much fire and intensity that when he speaks he \\' s almost as convincing and arresting a public speaker as , say , malcom x . when we first see him , he \\' s clean shaven , with a jet black swastica emrboidered on his left breast , a devlish goatee , and he \\' s attacking the black carjackers outside of his house dressed in nothing but his white boxers and carrying a handgun in his hand that never seems to run out of bullets , at least when he doesn \\' t need them . he so believes in his convictions that he \\' s willing to put his beliefs to the test , even if he knows it will mean a stop in prison , if only for a couple years . \" american history x \" is about derek , how he became a neo - nazi skinhead , how he rose to power , how he was rehabilitated in prison after murdering two black men in a fit of rage that was less to do with the stealing of his car and more to do with proving himself , and how he tried to save others , namely his younger brother , from making the same mistake . we see him at all of these stages - as a smart teenager , a vicious hate monger , a man having an epiphany , and the man who tries to correct what he \\' s done before - and in all of these , we get a portrait of a man from all sides . or at least , that \\' s the intention . the film \\' s framing device is his brother , danny ( edward furlong , perpetually looking about 13 ) , also now a skinhead , and how his principal , bob sweeney ( avery brooks , who i just found out was or is the captain on star trek \\' s deep space 9 ) , is trying to \" correct \" him . when the film opens , danny has just written a book report on \" mein kampf , \" landing him in trouble with sweeney , which causes him to make him write a paper on derek \\' s life and how it has gotten him nowhere . coincidentally , this day is the day derek is released from prison , and when we see him , he \\' s cleaned - up , not as buff , and has a full head of hair . he \\' s just as intelligent , but still very rough along the edges , but he \\' s wisened up . he \\' s no longer controlled by his anger at blacks and jews , and tries to persuade danny , who \\' s becoming what derek was before , to give up his lifestyle . but danny won \\' t . he goes to a large skinhead beer bash , meets with the skinhead leader ( stacy keach ) , and then discovers that derek is as opposed to neo - nazi - dom as he was for it a couple of years ago . the film circles around this , then spins off into non - linear flashbacks , all done in black and white . we mostly see derek at his prime as a skinhead , living in venice beach , organizing vicious and quasi - sadistic raids on local stores that no longer hire the white , middle - class teenagers since they can easily get cheaper illegal immigrants to do the same work , and mouthing off his theories on affirmative action and how illegal immigrants and blacks have destroyed the fundamentals this country was built on . to them , the white man is the one who has gotten the fuzzy end of the lolipop , and he not only speaks elloquently , forcefully , and intelligently , but he backs everything up with political reasons , justifying their rage at least to them . and frighteningly enough , much of what he says sounds true . \" american history x \" is a collection of really great scenes and moments , rather than a cohesive , great film that flows effortlessly from one moment to the next . in it , there are some of the best scenes i \\' ve seen all year . one scene features a dinner between derek \\' s family , and his mother \\' s newest boyfriend ( played with reserve by eliott gould ) , a jewish liberal who quietly disagrees with derek \\' s rightist views , launching the scene into a fit of rage and anger that builds unparalled emotions in the audience ( gould \\' s reaction to derek \\' s final summation is unnerrving ) . another scene uses humor and traditional macho sex talk to build a friendship and a nice connection between derek and a black co - worker ( guy torry ) while folding laundry in prison . and another soon - to - be - classic is actually divided in two : the murder of the two black men that winds derek in jail , which contains a final murder so nasty that it may be the most revoltingly shocking all year . there \\' s much more to appreciate , like the acting , which is uniformly good , with stand - outs coming from avery brooks , beverly d \\' angelo ( as the long - suffering mother ) , and gould ( who has one horrible line , but other than that , comes off with the best performance he \\' s given in what seems like a really long time ) . norton walks off with the film , though , coming off with such intensity that he reduces anyone not doing an adequate job to rubble . in only the fifth movie of his career , norton has invented himself as one of the most reliable and intense actors of his generation , and maybe the best . there \\' s nothing like it when norton really gets rolling in this movie , spewing out lines with such authority that he commands all attention from the audience , coming off with power similar to that of a young maron brando . that he allows the little emotions to seep through is amazing . sadly enough , this isn \\' t going to be the great portrait of racism that it perhaps hopes to be . it \\' s too unambitious and even a little contrived to really take off as either a powerful statement or an emotional masterpiece . the ending , especially , is pencilled in from other movies , tossed in just so the emotional keyboard can be trounced upon . some of the skinheads are reduced to mere cliches ( kevin smith regular ethan suplee fairs rather annoyingly as the \" fat skinhead , \" whose lines consist without fail of expressing his desire to eat more ) , and even the dramatic arc isn \\' t as well travelled . furlong \\' s danny never seems to really be learning a lesson , since the flashbacks refuse to show his point of view , and when he decides to make a change by the end ( which was inevitable ) , it doesn \\' t seem like it has actually arrived there . even derek \\' s descent into skinhead - dom doesn \\' t seem justified . though his fireman father ( william russ , the dad from \" boy meets world , \" and don \\' t ask me how i know that ) is killed by a black junkie , and even before he spoke against affirmative action intelligently , there never seems to be any real back story why derek became so intense about his beliefs . as such , one can see why the director , tony kaye , wanted to have his name removed . sorta . \" american history x \" is a very good movie , and i was very moved by it , but it could be a lot better , and the problem seems to be that the cut as it is is not up to what he claims to be his potential . somewhere , he claims , there lies a tony kaye cut , and that was to be the true cut until it was viewed by norton , who then ordered another cut , and that is thus . although he aimed for the directing credit to go to \" alan smithee , \" the resident name for any film that is to be disowned by its director , it wasn \\' t allowed to him , under the grounds that once you disown a film , you can not badmouth it ( but really , that \\' s the macguffin - no one really wanted a film this good to be given the alan smithee sign of disapproval ) . kaye \\' s right in that it \\' s not up to par , even if he \\' s not referring to normal par but rather his own personal par . this will not be a \" do the right thing \" for the late 90s . yet it still gets its point across intelligently , and backs it up with its story ( its message , that one cannot be so enwrapped in one \\' s own beliefs or pain and suffering will occur , is literally said over the narration , unfortunately ) . and even if it isn \\' t perfect , at least when avery brooks turns to norton after he has been beaten and raped in prison , and asks him if anything he \\' s done has made his life any better , it realy hits a nerve , not only in derek , but also in the audience .',\n",

' ' laughter ' is supposed to arise from the ' comical ' events , but never does . many bad films have good intentions , but my favourite martian doesn ' t appear to try to provide any entertainment . filled to the brim with wham bang special effects , my favourite martian offers little more than some nice eye candy . christopher lloyd mugs his way through the entire movie , i ' ve never seen a man pull a face for 93 minutes until now . jeff daniels plays ' staple nice guy ' and his role is useless . his performance is incredibly lazy , although his paperthin character doesn ' t deserve more than the performance he gives . darryl hannah looks as pretty as ever , but her role is somewhat , erm , limited . hurley mistakes ' acting ' for ' shouting and looking like a twit ' and wins the david wilcock award for ' most irritating , godawful performance in a moving picture . ' way to go liz ! for the supporting cast , disney manage to assemble every character actor out there , during the film i was going ' he was the guy in . . . ah . . er . . . ' before finally giving up and switching off . another major setback is the staple ' comedy sidekick . ' unfortunately , the writers ( sherri stoner and deanna oliver , if anyone cares ) forget that a comedy sidekick needs to be ' funny . ' instead , they deliver zoot , the martians deeply unfunny sidekick . although meant to be a manic character no doubt , every line that comes out of his ' neck ' is a dud . a real dud . citizen kane delivers more laughs a minute than his hell spawn piece of polyester . even the kids in the audience were insulted by this character : not one child even bothered to smirk . it ' s a nice special effect , though . another problems with this comedy are the gags themselves . or rather , the lack of them . my favourite martian reaches a new level of toilet humour : it goes past the bowl , down the pipe and into the sewer . now , toilet humour can be funny , as dumb and dumber ( 1994 ) humorously showed . but here , characters farting , belching and almost getting crapped on ( literally ) is not ' amusing . ' it ' s insulting . there ' s one good gag right before the credits , but it appears the guy who wrote that gag tragically died and his unfunny twin continued . either that , or they were hoping that easy to please six year olds wouldn ' t mind the fact that his movie is beaten by men at work in the funny stakes . yes , men at work . yowza ! the fact that a lot of money was pumped into this film , and that they actually got people to agree to be in this film just depresses me even more . there are thousands of brilliant films out there that can ' t get distribution , yet trash like this gets released nation - wide with ease . thankfully , as soon as it makes it ' s money , it will never be seen again , and my favourite martian will end up where the two lead characters do near the end of the movie : down the toilet .\",\n",

              " ('\" the tailor of panama \" is a different kind of spy movie . despite the presence of pierce brosnan , there is nary a hint of james bond flash here . instead of big action scenes , leering super villains and empty - headed femme fatales , we get interesting characters and an intriguing situation . based on the novel by john le carr ? , who also co - wrote the screenplay , the film offers viewers something rarely seen in theaters this time of year : a solid , well - told story . brosnan plays andy osnard , a british operative walking on thin ice . his british superiors ship him off to panama , making sure he understands that he had better not screw up the placement . osnard arrives in the tropics virtually oozing contempt for his new co - workers and his new home base . when shown the bridge of the americas by a person marveling over the fact that , since the creation of the panama canal , the structure is the sole connection between north and south america , he barely keeps from yawning . brosnan clearly relishes the chance to be the antithesis of 007 , investing the suave spy with a distinct reptilian quality coupled with an air of indifference that irks his fellows to no end . searching for a way to get information on the government , osnard sets his sights on harry pendel ( geoffrey rush ) , an unctuous tailor serving the panamanian elite . harry claims to be a transplant from britain \\' s renowned saville row , but osnard knows his secret : the tailor is an ex - con who served five years in prison after torching his uncle \\' s shop in an insurance scam . he also knows that harry is up to his ears in debt , having spent a fortune on an unsuccessful farm . osnard offers harry a way out . he will pay for information harry has gathered from his upscale clientele . eager to comply , harry offers what he knows , then starts concocting tidbits to keep the money flowing . before long , he is forced to spy on his loving wife , louisa ( jamie lee curtis ) , an aide to the canal director . harry \\' s little lies build , eventually taking on a life of their own . osnard turns in reports about the \" silent opposition , \" a group threatening to upset the balance of control over the canal . the bogus revelation proves explosive , leading to meetings in washington d . c . over how to best protect the vital waterway . meanwhile , osnard wallows in his newfound status , enjoying the best the city has to offer and wooing an attractive co - worker . and harry grows ever more fretful , fearing the consequences if his clients , not to mention his wife , learn about his lies . geoffrey rush is wonderful as harry , fawning over his customers by day and savoring his rich family life in the evenings , all while playing secret agent in the off hours with his new benefactor . rush makes harry a credible figure , presenting the various levels of the character so effectively that he remains sympathetic despite his duplicity . after gaining fame playing larger than life characters , rush flips everything around for this role , using his energy to depict the quiet desperation of a man slowly realizing that the solution to his troubles may be worse than the original problems . although she gets far too little screen time , jamie lee curtis imbues louisa with a depth greater than the screenplay provides her . of the central characters , she is the only one that exhibits maturity and genuine self - confidence . curtis is one of my favorite female actors ; whiplash smart , sultry and charismatic , she deserves more than supporting roles . speaking of supporting characters , there are some great ones here . harold pinter is amusing as harry \\' s uncle benny , who pops up throughout the story in a number of creative ways . also shoring up the proceedings is jon polito as a corrupt banker and dylan baker , who is a riot as a united states general straight out of the dr . strangelove school of armed patriotism . but the most important secondary performers are leonor varela and brendan gleeson , both outstanding as two wounded activists . their presence adds weight to the story , reminding us that beyond the charades of the leading men , there are real people that have suffered greatly over the politics connected to the canal . director john boorman adds additional verisimilitude by shooting the film on location . instead of using panama city merely as a colorful backdrop , he adroitly weaves in footage of all aspects of life there . the metropolis , described by one character as \" casablanca without heroes \" pulsates with life , underling the folly of the two foreigners playing dangerous games that could have a disastrous impact on a great many people . \" the tailor of panama \" succeeds because the principals behind it were bright enough to make it more than a simple entertainment .',\n",

              " ('ready to rumble is not a masterpiece in film ; i have a problem even regarding it as a film . it \\' s more of a show , a big commercial for ted turner \\' s world championship wrestling ( wcw ) . the movie is almost entirely about and fully showcases the wrestlers of the wcw like diamond dallas page , goldberg , and sting . the story is very minimal and basic . there are these two guys , gordy ( david arquette ) and sean ( scott caan ) . they are two twenty - something wrestling fans from wyoming . when they go to a live event for the big match up , there favorite wrestler jimmy king ( oliver platt ) is defeated and his career is announced to be over by the mean commissioner titus ( joe pantoliano ) . gordy and sean decide to go on a quest to find jimmy and bring him back to the top and defeat the evil titus \\' plans . on the way , they meet some people , have some fun , and clean up some port - o - potties . sounds great huh , well it \\' s not . the movie makes many attempts at humor , only a few of them work . the jokes that make you laugh , however , do not outnumber the film \\' s many duds . there is a funny repertoire between arquette and a convenience store cashier played by ahmet zappa . the cashier is very mean to arquette so arquette dreams of ways to get him back . i especially enjoyed one version in which they have a wrestling match and arquette \\' s tag team partner is \\' macho man \\' randy savage . they wrestle between the aisles knocking over cans and getting body slammed on the floor . the other good part of the film is the sexual confrontation between arquette and rose mcgowan . mcgowan plays sasha the head nitro girl , the cheerleaders of the wcw . she becomes attracted to gordy and they have some nice , funny scenes together especially one scene in which arquette calls mcgowan \\' s breasts foreign objects than punches her directly into the face . now what didn \\' t work in this movie ? that would be the rest of it . the flick was filled with stupid potty humor about farts and toilets . the two lead characters work for a port - o - potty cleaning company and when they crash the truck , the excrements spill all over the road . it \\' s not funny ; it \\' s pathetic and brainless . the film is giving homage to how blindly faithful of their wrestlers but not all wrestling fans are that way . i watch it for entertainment and i would think some people would take offense to what is said throughout the movie . the main characters in the film actually get to wrestle , like that would happen to any fan , especially to 2 that stalk a wrestler and sneak him back onto set . also , i wondered how they got into the backstage so easily ; they just walked right in . i like wrestling . i watch it at home and laugh . it \\' s continuously funny and has great characters otherwise i wouldn \\' t watch it . this movie wasn \\' t even funny or fun to watch like the wrestling on tv . the only fun i had in the movie was pointing out the wrestlers i knew . the funny thing was that many of the wcw featured wrestlers like saturn and chris benoit have left wcw for more money but are still featured in the film prominently . the movie was too dim - witted to be funny . it is possibly the most useless and under - developed film ever . a recent film in this genre of fans would be the kiss fan film , detroit rock city . that movie was interesting , well done and continuously funny unlike this film . the acting was good plus the jokes had humor and made you laugh . now that the scream trilogy is over , arquette has nothing else to do so he has to do crap like this and be a spokesman in those dumb 1 - 800 - call - att ads . at least he has a hot wife in courtney cox . he \\' s in the funny parts of the film but there aren \\' t enough to make him look good . the music was bad also feature such overplayed tunes as kid rock \\' s \" bawitdaba \" and \" cowboy \" . martin landau has a great cameo as a classic , hard - nosed wrestling trainer named sal that whips the king back into shape to regain his throne . script is important to a film but this piece of crap could have been made with a couple of scribblings on a napkin . a fan of the wrestlers who are featured in the film probably wrote it . at times the movie even tries to show wrestling as real . the wrestlers form alliances , go to people \\' s houses and beat them up . it \\' s utterly ridiculous . the whole film was a wasteful , dumfounding experience . the movie was made to pay homage to the fans , telling them things that made wrestling , not the wrestlers . the wrestlers are making more money to make a movie to thank the fans for begin fans by paying 5 dollars to see a potty - humor movie . the wcw sucks and this movie is just a pathetic two - hour commercial to watch it . if you \\' re going to watch wrestling watch wwf , it \\' s actually entertaining . the wrestling is betters , they \\' re funnier , more diverse , and have better entrance themes . oh and the girls are hotter . is this what movies have become , 2 hour - long commercials that you have to pay to see ? don \\' t waste your money .',\n",

) in the hospital . tensions mount and distrust build among the rest as they watch their chance for the bonus start to slip away . but , there is more , much more , at stake as the hospital and its history of insanity weigh on them all . i don \\' t want to give away too much of the story of \" session 9 , \" so i \\' ll stop there . what we have here is a spooky horror flick that uses none of the jump - out - at - you - from - the - dark cheap shots that have become part and parcel with horror films since the advent of \" halloween \" and \" friday the thirteenth . \" there is no cat leaping out of the dark or the shock of suddenly seeing oneself in a strategically placed mirror . with the exception of one shadowy and chilling image at one point spooky interlude in the film , there is little that you can get your arms around as far as what , specifically , is \" frightening . \" as i watched \" session 9 \" i became aware of the subtle things that built up during the story that make it a true horror movie . the striking high - definition video camera work by uta briesewitz ( who worked with the director , brad anderson , on his \" next stop wonderland \" ) helps to build up tension with close - ups , fluid camera movement and odd angles in a way that would make alfred hitchcock proud . music , too , is used to intense effect , joining with the camera to make simple scenes frightening , even horrifying . couple these tech feats with an intelligent story that uses elements of \" the shining , \" \" the blair witch project \" and , even \" the texas chainsaw massacre \" and you get a decent , intriguing horror flick . additionally , the brilliant decision to shoot at danvers state hospital gives the film another starring character , the institution itself , which lends even more chills to the equation . acting is another factor that raises \" session 9 \" above the usual dreck presented in recent horror hits like \" scream , \" \" i know what you did last summer \" and their sequels . those films took good - looking , though generic , young actors and actresses and put them to use to build up a body count , substituting mayhem for real horror . anderson opted , instead , to use mature , experienced actors like peter mullan and david caruso to fill his characters \\' shoes and the difference in casting quality is notable . mullan , in particular , puts an arc on his character , gordon , as the troubled guy who slowly and inexorably falls under the pressures of family , job and , finally , danvers state hospital . the rest of the small cast fit the bill as people , not just fodder for the mayhem . david caruso , as gordo \\' s senior man and near equal in the business , shows just how good an actor he is . he made the jump from tv \\' s \" nypd blue \" to film far too soon and his decisions in the roles he took ( i \\' ll never forget the horrendous \" jade \" ) were less than star making . he rolls his sleeves up and does the job well here . gevedon , lucas and sexton are more than fodder , too . the only problem with \" session 9 \" lay in the uninspired ending . it takes on a fairly conventional finale that covers old ground and is a bit of a disappointment after the terrific ( and inspired ) build up . the pleasure is getting there and i wish that anderson and gevedon had kept up the steam they had so ably built during the bulk of the film \" session 9 \" is an unusual feat . it is scary , doesn \\' t use cheap tricks and raises goose bumps with its intelligently rendered , subtle horror . because of the local interest of danvers , it should do well with the northeast crowd . i hope it gets the national distribution it deserves . i give it a b + .',\n",

              " ('when i first heard about scream in 1996 , i was told that it was a spoof of horror movies . from the master of the horror himself , wes craven , it ridiculed the cliches of the genre by overemphasizing them , by making the teenagers do what they know they \\' re not supposed to do when a serial killer is stalking them ( don \\' t run up the stairs when you can easily go out the front door , never say \" i \\' ll be right back , \" etc . ) . when i first heard this description , i figured that it was an easy way out of making a bad movie . how hard is it to make an extremely terrible film but claim it is actually a mockery of other bad movies . was this wes craven \\' s remedy from making \" real \" bad movies such as vampires in brooklyn ? it just seemed cheap to me . then i actually saw the movie and the first twenty minutes , involving drew barrymore and a nail - bitingly intense phone conversation , completely changed my attitude . scream is not only a clever parody of your standard horror flick , it \\' s also a pretty scary movie . if you \\' ve seen a million of these kinds of films , you know exactly what is going to happen . this is part of the fun of watching scream . the movie reminds avid horror fans how similar and repetitive the genre is and it also reminds them how great a guilty pleasure it can be to watch pointless and predictable violence to innocent , attractive teenagers . to those who rarely see these types of movies , scream is a thrilling unpredictable ride that could be mistaken as a serious slasher film . there \\' s nothing wrong with that misjudgment though . i have witnessed viewers from both sides of the audience , the newbies to horror and the fanatics . their opinions on the film were so different but both very positive . from these varied reviews , i am convinced that scream has not only revived the teen horror movie and the normal teen romance movies but also the hilarious parodies of these and other categories . films that both deride and celebrate genres like galaxy quest and the big hit would not have existed , in my opinion , if it was not for the outstanding success of scream . the low - budget 1996 gem may , alongside pulp fiction , be the most influential film of the 1990 \\' s . this influence may exist to the chagrin of some moviegoers who despise movies like teaching mrs . tingle or television programs such as dawson \\' s creek but to others such as myself , we congratulate the movie that has opened new doors for excellent young actors , screenwriters , and directors . scream is also an extremely funny movie thanks to its quickly - paced script by kevin williamson . within the film are characters who tell other characters , as well as the audience , the basic rules and cliches of a horror movie . mainly from the rants of randy ( jamie kennedy ) and stu ( matthew lillard ) , we are reminded not only of the obvious and hilarious rules but also some of the more subtle stereotypes that when thought over are mostly true as well ( the virgin always survives ; have sex and you \\' re dead meat ) . not only are we treated these rules on a plate but also the rules are referenced to a number of different films and actors . the script feels like an obsessive essay from a college film geek who has nothing better to do but find every little blunder from every little film for his own self - satisfaction . in this case , williamson finds these errors for the audience \\' s satisfaction and amusement . i hear there is a new movie coming out called scary movie which is a spoof of scream , which is a spoof of scary movies . i will certainly see the film but i have the feeling that this parody will be more obviously ridiculing the genre rather than scream \\' s perfect subtlety . however my last gut feeling about this stuff , scream , was dead wrong . . . so who knows .',\n",

( carter has a problem , through most of the film , with hitting a woman , but this falls aside with their eventual one - on - one melee at the conclusion . ) roselyn sanchez is knockdown gorgeous ( and resembles sandra bullock ) as undercover agent isabella molina - she doesn \\' t add much to the equation but is terrific to watch . director ratner and the original \" rush hour \" production team have assembled a crew of skilled craftsmen to work behind the camera . cinematographer matthew f . leonetti has had a long career of shooting action flicks and gives \" rh2 \" the fluid camera movement the genre film needs . production design by terrence marsh spans continents and gives the right look , whether it is in a hong kong karaoke bar or a high stakes las vegas casino . the rest of the techs are of the same high quality . i \\' m surprised to even say that \" rush hour 2 \" is the most entertaining of the summer blockbuster movies . it takes the best of the first film and kicks jurassic dino butt in its fun , frolic and fast pace and is the best mainstream thing out , so far , this summer . i give it a b .',\n",

              " ('note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . be forewarned . like its own opening shot , from out of the darkness boogie nights triumphantly explodes upon the film scene with stunning authority and clarity , persuasively heralding its helmer paul thomas anderson as a bonafide major talent . a sprawling epic set in the heart of the disco era and focused upon the ascension and decline of a troupe in the adult film industry , boogie nights is an astonishingly ambitious feature film which is completely effective both as an utterly entertaining joyride and as a strikingly impressive piece of filmmaking . the film follows a soft - spoken young man , eddie adams ( mark wahlberg ) from torrance , through his induction into the erotic picture business to stardom , and later , to a harrowingly precipitous drop . as boogie nights opens , he \\' s toiling as a dishwasher in a trendy san fernando valley nightclub , and living at home under the thumb of a tyrannical mother who denigrates him at every opportunity . recruited by fatherly jack horner ( a rejuvenated burt reynolds ) , a successful porn filmmaker , eddie abandons his old life in favour of a new one as dirk diggler , pornstar . wholeheartedly embraced by jack \\' s troupe , including the maternal amber waves ( julianne moore ) , reed rothchild ( john c . reilly ) , buck swope ( don cheadle ) , rollergirl ( heather graham ) , dirk and his \" one special thing \" are quickly propelled to the top of his field , fulfilling his mantra of being a \" big bright shining star \" . his lack of discipline , however , incites a chain of circumstances which sees dirk and his friends unravel as a new decade is ushered in . the element of boogie nights which literally commands attention is the bravura direction by mr . anderson , whose fascination and prowess with the camera is obvious . from the terrific tracking shot throughout a nightclub which opens the film and introduces the players through to the showy sequence in the camera follows a female partygoer diving into a pool , mr . anderson \\' s accomplished command of the camera is without question . while novice directors often demonstrate an unfortunate lack of restraint in terms of flamboyant camerawork which ultimately proves to be aggravating , impertinent and self - congratulatory ( case in point : marc rocco \\' s unforgettable perpetual - motion helming of murder in the first ) , in boogie nights every zoom or pan by mr . anderson , be it slow and deliberate or energetically sharp , is purposeful and potent . it \\' s a rarity and a delight to discover such a confidently assured work so early in a filmmaker \\' s career -- boogie nights is only his second feature film , following up his debut feature from earlier this year , hard eight -- and although it \\' s somewhat derivative ( his storytelling style is reminiscent of robert altman , while in terms of visuals he \\' s clearly influenced by martin scorsese ) , at least he \\' s borrowing from some of the best , and it \\' s entirely effective within the context of this film . while boogie nights is astonishingly polished from a technical perspective , in terms of sheer entertainment value it \\' s also rollicking good fun , with a wickedly deadpan sense of humour . the film perfectly captures the essence of the disco period in terms of music , clothes , hairstyles , dance , idioms , and culture , aided immeasurably by impeccable production design by bob ziembicki and costume design by mark bridges , and boogie nights convincingly catapults the audience back to this recent , pre - aids - scare period in american history where uninhibited , free - wheeling lifestyles abounded . while much of the film \\' s humour pertains to the characters \\' obliviousness of now - outdated aspects of their lives then prevalent in society -- a prime example is part - time salesman buck swope \\' s demo of a stereo system with an eight - track tape , and inviting a prospective customer to get \\' freaky deaky \\' with the music -- it \\' s elicited with an undercurrent not of ridicule , but of wistful reminiscence , and some the throwback elements in the film are strangely wondrous . a giant ensemble disco dance production number in a nightclub is funny , to be sure , but oddly magical , and the sequence which lovingly explores eddie / dirk \\' s bedroom , completely adorned with posters and elements of iconic 1970s figures ( farrah fawcett , cheryl tiegs , bruce lee ) is breathtaking . ably supported by a well - selected collection of period music ( all of which purportedly came straight from mr . anderson \\' s personal collection ) , there \\' s a clear affection for the era in boogie nights . it \\' s the period aspect and the playfully comic nostaligism of boogie nights which has been played up in its marketing campaign in deference of the pornography element of the storyline ; the film \\' s promotional trailer markedly avoids any explicit reference to the adult film industry which unites its characters . after the debacle with 1996 \\' s milos forman film , the people vs . larry flynt , another finely - crafted work which was knocked off the market prematurely due to controversy regarding its pornography - related storyline , the new line marketing team faced a unique challenge with boogie nights in terms of attempting to deemphasize the relatively risque erotic picture element of the story in order to increase salability to the general public . however , while boogie nights delves into the world of the adult film industry of two decades ago , it \\' s hardly a lurid or seamy film -- given the subject matter , there \\' s very little nudity , and virtually none of it can be construed as gratuitous -- and boogie nights smartly depicts erotic filmmaking not as a hotbed of carnality , but simply as a business . the glimpses on the sets of jack horner \\' s shoots reveal that while the films he makes are intended to titillate , there \\' s a candid matter - of - factness in terms of sex ; his cast and crew are professionals who are merely doing a job , and it \\' s refreshing that the obvious cliches of depravity and sinful lechery often linked to dismissive portraits of adult filmmaking , such as coercion or debauchery , are avoided . if anything , boogie nights is more interested in the process of adult filmmaking than the adult films themselves . jack horner \\' s dream is an honourable one -- he genuinely aspires to make a great film -- and to some degree boogie nights is reminiscent of ed wood ( albeit lacking a certain wistful innocence ) . in both films , the world of quickie low - budget filmmaking is explored , and both jack horner and the version of ed wood by tim burton , scott alexander , and larry karaszewski share similar mindsets -- jack \\' s retort of \" there are shadows in light , baby \" to his cinematographer \\' s complaint about poor set lighting echoes back to ed wood \\' s \" it \\' s not about the little details , it \\' s about the big picture ! \" rant when it is pointed out that his graveyard set for plan 9 from outer space appears patently false . in boogie nights and ed wood , the aspirations of the respective filmmakers \\' prove to be bemusing , not in their intentions -- there \\' s nothing inherently silly in the goal of making an \\' artistic \\' erotic picture -- but in the degree that they miss the mark . much like the humour lacing ed wood , the laughs involving jack horner are double - edged ; after viewing a hilarious excerpt from one of his latest films which hybridizes the james bond and porn genres , when jack breathes \" this is the best work i \\' ve ever done \" , it \\' s genuinely funny , but given his utter sincerity , also possesses a tinge of sadness . mr . anderson is at this point clearly a greater talent as a director than a screenwriter . while boogie nights shows great inventiveness in staging , there really isn \\' t any clever dialogue in the film , though a valid point certainly can be made that none of the film \\' s characters particularly lend themselves to thoughtful verbal exchanges ; when one considers that the film \\' s * protagonist * literally doesn \\' t say a single insightful thing throughout the entire 152 minute running time , it \\' s no wonder why the playfully inane \" how much can you bench ? \" banter between dirk and reed constitutes one of the film \\' s finest exchanges . and while mr . anderson creates a rich collection of fascinating characters , it \\' s problematic that some of the the threads given to the film \\' s characters are simply stale material -- julianne moore \\' s child custody battle is fairly cliched stuff , better suited for a less risque and uninspired tv - movie version of her character \\' s story , and far less interesting than the thread dealing with her woefully hackneyed filmmaking ambitions . still , even if he doesn \\' t always know what to do with his characters , mr . anderson most definitely captures their essences , and his resolutely nonjudgemental affection for them is infectious -- misguided , even aimless , hopelessly naive , self - destructive , insufferable : i loved them just the same . in any case , it \\' s hard to pick nits with a screenplay which contains one of the most audacious and inspired ( and ultimately best - executed ) scenes of the year : a scene where dirk diggler and reed rothchild are dragged along by their loose - cannon compadre to the home of drug baron rahad jackson ( a mesmerizing alfred molina in an unforgettable performance , even if it \\' s a small one ) in a suicidal drug deal scam , only to find that the millionaire is a crazed eccentric ( the part where he stops the deal to listen to the crescendo of night ranger \\' s \" sister christian \" on his stereo system is sheer brilliance ) flanked by an armed bodyguard . if this scene already wasn \\' t tense enough with these elements , mr . anderson introduces a chinese boy that wanders through the scene , who for no discernable reason is tossing firecrackers around the room , pushing the scene to a new , surreal level of delightful giddiness . there are some other interesting touches in boogie nights . mr . anderson recycles the use of long methodical chimes on the soundtrack from hard eight ; here , it accompanies the violent intercut sequences which depict the prostration of various characters to frightening effect . similarly , a painful scene where crew member scotty j ( philip seymour hoffman ) breaks down in tears in the driver \\' s seat , sobbing \" i \\' m so stupid \" after being rebuffed by dirk after an awkward but heartfelt advance is strikingly played out exactly as a later scene with dirk in the driver \\' s seat after a particularly tumultuous and traumatic evening . boogie nights is exceedingly well cast , and each of the actors rise to the occasion ; the ensemble cast is uniformly good . while most of the acting accolades will no doubt go to mr . wahlberg ( fulfilling upon the sparks of promise he demonstrated in some of his earlier films ) and mr . reynolds ( terrific as the father figure and stable anchor of the film , ringing true in every respect ) , a handful of other performances which might otherwise be overlooked deem mention . mr . reilly demonstrates here , as he did for brief glimpses in ulu grosbard \\' s georgia , a genuine aptitude for comedy -- many of his scenes in boogie nights are among the very funniest in the film . i \\' m not sure how much of his performance as reed was scripted and how much was done on the spot , but he plays the quintessential second banana character to a tee . mr . reilly is the best part of the big disco dance production number , and it \\' s wickedly funny to watch his reed join in with dirk after the fact in threatening the new stud on the block during a macho altercation . worth the price of admission alone is the glimpse of him getting down in the recording studio while the dirk character is laying down a numbingly bad ( and dead - on period ; it sure sounds like bad early 1980s to me ) demo track \" you got the touch \" in a vain attempt at a musical career . mr . reilly plays his vacant character with utter conviction which is convincing and effective . ms . graham , with her long dirty blonde hair , innocent demeanour , and huge hazel eyes , looks like a disney animated heroine come to life -- or in this case , a disney animated heroine who came to life , made a wrong turn , and ended up on the new line lot in a film focused on the late 70s / early 80s adult film industry . consequently , it \\' s a bit incongruous to see this cheery sweet - faced starlet whizzing about the set on her roller skates , but in a scene where she \\' s lounging in a limousine prowling the streets , garish red lipstick messily smeared on , giving the camera a hilariously pouty come - hither look , all one can do is gulp . her role in the film sadly needs more fleshing out ( err -- in a figurative sense ) -- she \\' s essentially a glorified extra -- but she does score impressively in her key scene which is unnerving in its sheer primal ferocity . ( if only mr . anderson had filmed the scene so that we could actually see the expression of rage and anguish on her face , though ! ) and a cautionary tale for the strict and prudish : as a teen , ms . graham \\' s parents forbade her to take a part in the twisted cult classic heathers ; since then , her most notable roles have been as a junkie ( gus van sant \\' s drugstore cowboy ) and now a porn starlet . draw your own conclusions . perhaps the most quietly touching performance in boogie nights is that of mr . cheadle , who lends dignity to his role as a character in search of his identity , and whose quest is comically manifested by a series of changes in his sense of fashion . his relationship with his cheerfully supportive new wife jessie st . vincent ( an interesting melora walters ) is wholly compelling has genuine sweetness , and although his general longing for acceptance from others is perceptible , it \\' s no more so than in the bank scene where his loan application to open a stereo store is rejected due to his background in the porn industry . while the scenario is familiar , the wounded look in cheadle \\' s eyes makes the scene unforgettable . luis guzman \\' s most famous work is possibly in brian de palma \\' s carlito \\' s way , and here he plays a variation on the same character : maurice t . rodriguez is a hapless but good - natured nightclub owner who \\' s a hanger - on to jack \\' s group , ingratiating himself into the clique and constantly hounding jack , with little disguise made of his desperation , for a part in one of his erotic pictures . jack \\' s eventual acquiescence to maurice \\' s request leads to one of boogie nights \\' biggest comic payoffs . boogie nights is a stunning achievement due to the virtuoso direction by mr . anderson , who immediately asserts his presence in the film industry as a presence of note with this work . striking a fine balance between humour and drama , and exceptionally well - crafted , there \\' s no doubt that boogie nights is among the very best films of the year .',\n",

              " (\"dear god , this is a fantastically bad film ! regardless of what i say about knock off , you can ' t grasp its awfulness from my words . you have to see it and experience it for yourself . here ' s the kicker , though -- i suggest that you do so . yes , this is a bad film -- easily one of the most incompetent films of the year -- but it has a certain misguided charm that makes it a unique kind of disaster to endure . in fact , i enjoyed myself for most of its brief running time , despite the dreadful acting and a completely incomprehensible story . don ' t get me wrong : i ' m not excusing knock off . it reaches an unacceptable level of badness ; it ' s so incoherent that i wonder if it was hacked up worse than the avengers was . it also features some truly terrible performances from lela rochon , michael wong , paul sorvino , and -- of course -- jean - claude van damme . it does , however , have the entertaining presence of rob schneider , and the excessively inventive and pretentious direction of tsui hark . as i watched it , i occasionally wondered if it was aware of its own awfulness . now , in retrospect , it seems clear that it wasn ' t , but it ' s still a fascinating kind of mess . i don ' t like writing plot descriptions ( it is , by far , the most boring part of writing a review ) , but , in this case , i ' m off the hook : there is no way i could write an accurate synopsis for knock off . for the sake of comparison , i had no trouble understanding the usual suspects during my first viewing . i paid closer attention to knock off , and the only thing i am able to say about it is that van damme plays a dude named ray , and is accused by the cia ( i think ) of selling knock off products ( knock off products are , of course , products that look like name - brand materials but are generic and cheap ) . i don ' t know what any of this has to do with martial arts , but there are lots of martial arts in the film . ray is good at martial arts , so when he has to beat up bad guys , there ' s no problem . rob schneider plays his sidekick , although i had no idea who he really was by the end of the film . lela rochon is just some woman who accuses them of stuff , while paul sorvino is both the good guy and the bad guy at once ! in fact , every character goes through so many shifts from good to bad that the end provides absolutely no insight into what any of them really do . in that order , knock off is completely incoherent and makes absolutely no sense . but what a strange mess it is . it was written by stephen e . de souza , who also wrote die hard and 48 hours . can this be the same man ? i don ' t see how , unless , of course , huge chunks of the film have been removed for the sake of running time . knock off seems to have an interesting premise ( as far as action films go ) , but there ' s no semblance here . for instance , van damme is introduced , and then seconds later he ' s running a chariot race through the streets of hong kong . why ? who knows . what are the implications of this ? i have no idea . most action films abandon depth in favor of action , and this is normally a problem . knock off , however , is the first film that i would have preferred to see with all of the talky sequences cut . the acting is embarrassingly bad : rochon , in particular , delivers each of her lines with stiff and talentless insincerity . sorvino , in addition , deserves better than this . van damme is bad , but he ' s charming in that bad way , and so i can ' t say that he ' s hard to watch ( although i rarely understood what he was saying ) . the only exception is rob schneider , who is actually quite funny a lot of the time . tsui utilizes so many tricks that he makes john woo look tame by comparison . they ' re all pointless gimmicks though , such as shots of the inner - workings of a knock off running shoe . but his action scenes are never boring : one particular piece inside of a fruit factory ( a fruit factory ? ) is well - choreographed . lots of the scenes are pitched well to comedy , such as our heroes ' first encounter with the rochon character . but did tsui know that his film is beyond ludicrous ? i hope he did , for the alternative is a frightening thought . knock off has the feel of a truly terrible exercise in camp mania . if it were boring , i ' d give it zero stars . but it ' s not boring : it ' s loud and excessive and completely incoherent . it ' s also funny , even when it isn ' t meaning to be funny . a bad film that succeeds as entertainment doesn ' t deserve to be fully lambasted . i recognize knock off for its irrefutable badness , but i can ' t deny it ' s zany , useless charm . oh , i know , they ' re just action scenes looking desperately for a real story , but they ' re fun action scenes amongst a crowd of laughably inane concepts . it ' s fun to admire the awfulness of a film like this , but that doesn ' t excuse the fact that it is , indeed , awful .\",\n",

they aren \\' t real . the very foundation rohmer \\' s characters stand upon is false , and in their groundlessness they must discover themselves , in all their insubstantial glory . screened at the 2001 new york film festival ( feature coming soon ) .',\n",

( a heist comedy ? yup . deniro and hoffman are \" stealing \" the election , so to speak , and the movie is more about how they do it -- and the fun they have doing it -- than anything else . ) wag the dog succeeds because it \\' s based one great truth : the american people are stupid . ok , maybe it \\' s not \" love thy neighbor as thyself \" or even \" two plus two makes four \" , but a truth nonetheless . ( any average person who thinks that they \\' re really smart about the two things this movie satirizes -- moviemaking and the political process -- is invited , nay , challenged , to spend a week either watching a movie actually being made or 48 hours straight watching c - span when the house is in session . ) and because we \\' re so utterly , predictably stupid , hollywood knows that a certain percentage of us will go see hard rain or magoo , washington knows that we won \\' t notice a few million dollars spent here and there on porno art grants and cigar subsidies -- and deniro \\' s character knows that american geography skills are so weak that we won \\' t be able to locate albania on the map . the beauty of wag the dog is that it isn \\' t a light , meaningless comedy about politics ( like speechless , the michael keaton - geena davis picture ) or from the level of light - hearted politcal satire to near - greatness . nor is it a hard - edged cynical look at the manner in which a morally - deprived , ethically challenged baby - boomer connives his sleazy way into the white house ( like primary colors -- and yes , i am a little disappointed in the way the last two elections turned out , thanks for asking ) . instead , david mamet \\' s script strikes that delicate balance between comedy and cynicism needed for satire . it does this by keeping us in a fantasy world where most of the schemers \\' schemes come off beautifully , and fail only in entertaining and humorous fashion . deniro is playing a variation on his al capone character from the untouchables , without any of the violent rages . it \\' s all : \" what do i love ? what is it that brings me joy ? baseball , \" minus the savage bloody beating with the bat . he threatens a lot of people , mind you , but he \\' s doing it in a very nice , polite way . it \\' s a very mellow , restrained performance , which fits in with the air of gamesmanship in the script . hoffman , on the other hand , is giddy , exuberant and joyous . this kind of thing is what his character lives for , and he \\' s so excited that he can \\' t even shut up . even on the edge of disaster , he \\' s bright - eyed ( behind oddly tinted sunglasses ) and positive . insiders note that he \\' s basing his character on some powerful - but - anonymous producer -- which may or may not be true , but hoffman still exudes the kind of lets - put - on - a - show electricity that you figure a producer needs to have . the best part and the most frustrating part of wag the dog is in the supporting cast . the characters are so well drawn and so well acted that we want to see more of them , listen to them talk in that wised - up mamet dialogue , get to know them better -- which we don \\' t . anne heche , is dead - bang - on in her portrayal of a political press aide -- cool and composed on the outside , panicked and frenzied on the outside . denis leary ( one of my favorite actors -- see the ref ) is the \" fad king \" , who handles the profitable \" back - end \" -- t - shirt tie ins and shoe contracts and other creative , innovative ways to separate a fool from his money . they could make a whole movie , just about the fad king , and i \\' d go see it . willie nelson and merle haggard handle the musical end of things fabulously , from the upbeat gospel chorus theme song , to the weepy country waltz , to the hilarious \" ballad of the green berets \" parody . woody harrelson has a brief , but memorable part as the overmedicated \" hero \" of the albanian conflict . craig t . nelson , as the opposition candidate , and the ever - reliable william h . macy , as a wacky cia agent , are given surprisingly short shrift . ( one of my small gripes is that we never see what the spin doctors on the other side are doing . ) wag the dog is a funny movie about serious problems : the trivialization of american politics , the role of the press in dumbing down the issues , the impact of hollywood in creating campaign commercials , the reduction of all things political to soundbites and sidebars -- the list goes on . we can solve most of these problems by taking a greater role in our national life and educating ourselves as voters and citizens . wag the dog reminds us of what can happen if we don \\' t .',\n",

\\' - see , that \\' s provocative , leaves room for further questions . \" ) the film enjoys a few inspired moments - the urn scene , a session of nude bowling , the policeman joining in on terry and nick \\' s acid trip - but unfortunatetely these instances are few and far between , and for the most part the humour in dream with the fishes registers more as attempts rather than actual successes . this occurs particularly often during the film \\' s opening sequence - as terry is wrestling the bedridden nick for his watch in the hospital , i \\' m realising that this is * intended * to be funny , although nary a smile crept upon my lips - which is probably due to the obvious fact that it \\' s painfully clear to the audience from the outset that terry is going to be thwarted in his initial suicide attempts , sapping any element of surprise or amusement from nick \\' s scheme of tricking him ; this is not a film which has the wherewithal to kill off its leading star in the opening ten minutes . the entire sequence is , then , clearly an exercise for character exposition , with attempts at humour terribly diminished by utter predictability . among the cast , coming off best is david arquette , the current master in the portrayal of meek , squirming , stammering fresh - faced characters - he would have been terrific as the lead for george huang \\' s swimming with sharks - who gets to apply his adeptness for timidity as terry . mr . taylor ambitiously employs an interesting visual technique , where the portions of the film set in an urban environment have been processed to appear extremely grainy and heavily saturated , as opposed to a bright , crisp look for the smalltown scenes . the charge of dream with the fishes \\' s protagonists being wholly unempathetic is a bit of an odd one coming from me ; i seem to have a predilection for films with unlikeable characters , and indeed , in many cases have i been in the minority , supporting films which have been condemned as interminable due to the difficult , audience - unfriendly nature of their characters . for dream with the fishes , though , i did find myself on the flip side of coin , often hoping that the film would quickly conclude , and that the nick character would just hurry up and die .',\n",

( giorgio cantarini ) are a happy family . guido has finally fulfilled his dream of opening a bookstore . but racial and anti - semitic tensions are on the rise in italy , and guido has determined to do his best to shield his son from these harsh realities . the task becomes even the more difficult when the family is deported to a concentration camp . here , guido must use all his skill and imagination not only to shield his son , but to keep him from being exterminated . it is at this juncture in life is beautiful may tend to offend those whom the holocaust has touched . for the scenes in the concentration camp lack the horror , the pain , the unimaginable suffering of a schindler ' s list . true , many italian jews were not deported until the war was nearly over , and most were not sent to the death camps , but to work camps where they were used as slave labor . unlike steven spielberg , benigni is not out to tell the story of the holocaust . his story is about family and the lengths a parent will go to protect a child . for guido , to save his son , transforms the entire experience into an elaborate game . giosue ? must follow the rules without question to amass 1 , 000 points . the winner takes home a tank . therefore , guido tells him , he must remain hidden in the barracks . he cannot make a sound nor allow the guards to see him . guido explains this during a hilarious sequence when a german guard barks the camp instructions to the newly arrived inmates . guido , lying that he understands german and can translate for his fellow prisoners , instead lays down the rules for his son to allow him a chance to survive . throughout their imprisonment , guido ' s quick thinking continually keeps his son from harm ' s way . ultimately , the allies rescue the camp . in a poignant scene , giosue ? comes out of hiding just as an american tank rolls into the compound . the boy goes wide - eyed with wonderment and delight , thinking he has won the game . the price for his victory is most high . benigni has succeeded in using the blackest moment in human history to prove that even in hell , a ray of hope and salvation can penetrate the darkness . life is beautiful is a fantasy , a fable . it is not to be taken as a record of the holocaust . those who object to it are missing its point . and that is simply where there is hope , where there is life and where there is love , the spark of humanity will never be extinguished . committed to lifelong learning through effective communication\",\n",

              " ('perhaps the most dramatic changes in the motion picture industry in this decade have to do with special effects . there is no question that action - adventure and science - fiction / action movies are now judged by the character of their light and noise . whereas classic adventure pics of the last twenty years , such as raiders of the lost ark , were made in grand traditional fashion ; contemporary films like jurassic park are multimillion - dollar creations of computer technology . the latest in this visually awesome series of movies , the wachowski brothers \\' the matrix , is a testament to the skilled use of special effects and its ability to enhance a movie \\' s story . unlike many sci - fi movies which promote themselves as effects - heavy blockbusters but fail to deliver on that promise , the matrix is a carefully constructed special effects event . it runs 135 minutes in length and employs a countless number of computerized tricks which range from gimmick to grandiose , and the quality of the effects remains constant throughout the film \\' s length . contrary to popular trend , the matrix commits itself to being a spectacle of light and sound . in this regard , the movie is something like a card sharp . with its flashy mass stripped away , the matrix would be quite shallow and untalented . the script is characteristically weak , and the dialogue suffers in lieu of a far more innovative visual approach . but , like the card sharp , the matrix wows its audience to such a high degree that actual content is irrelevent . the viewers don \\' t care about what the matrix has to say as long as the next special effects sequence is right around the corner . and right around the corner they usually are , for the script tells a fast - paced , albeit frequently revisited story . as the movie explains , the world as we know it is nothing but an elaborate computer program constructed by an artificial intelligence for the purpose of placating mankind . billions of human beings lie in this dormant state while the intelligence -- the matrix -- \" farms \" our life energy . only a select group of individuals knows of the \" real \" world , and a particularly ingenious squad of these rebels is led by ultra - cool morpheus ( laurence fishburne ) . morpheus and his crew recruit a computer expert named neo ( keanu reeves ) , believing he is a prophesied individual who will help them overthrow the matrix and return peace to earth . the cast plays out this story in stylish fashion . the set design is very dynamic , running the gambit between cramped and dreary to bright and airy . the costumes , as well as the actors who wear them , add to the roles . for instance , the manifested antagonists in the movie , a group of \" agents \" created by the matrix in its computer program , all dress in matching secret servicewear ; the rebel fighters , on the other hand , dress in rich hues of leather . the casting cannot be criticized , for the typically stoic reeves isn \\' t required to say much and laurence fishburne gets plenty of time to be so damn cool . supports in carrie - anne moss , joe pantoliano , and hugo weaving are all effectual . one of the best comparisons to thw matrix is last year \\' s science fiction masterpiece dark city , particularly if one ponders how this same premise would \\' ve worked from a different approach . the alex proyas film was far more dark and introspective , requiring a bit of thought before themes became clear ; here , the wachowski brothers have managed to construct a thrill - ride motion picture with little abandon and much noise . the better picture between the two depends on the viewer , but the key to the success of the matrix is that the noise did not get in the way of the fun .',\n",

[ theater rating : * * 1 / 2 : good seats , average sound , picture unstable ] \" rounders \" is exactly the kind of movie parents don \\' t want their kids to see . it \\' s not that it \\' s a drunken orgy of sex and violence , but because it \\' s a film that flat - out says you can make a career out of gambling . and to take make things \" worse \" it proves this through its original , fascinating story . there have been countless crime films both past and present that evoke the \" noir \" mood , that is , the dark , shady atmosphere where the vices of the world become more fascinating on screen than they would in real life . this film starts off in the tradiational noir style , introducing us to the underworld of modern gambling where the stakes are high and so is the price for losing . matt damon stars as mike mcdermott , a 20 - something law student in present - day new york city who tells us how the game of poker is really played . damon narrates throughout the film , but the entire opening scene is voiced - over so perfectly to completely and totally define the setting . mike \\' s about to go up against teddy kgb ( malkovich ) , a russian gangster who looks like a serial killer . but then again , he practically is one and the film does everything to convey that sense - the look in his eyes , his slow movements , his intricate mannerisms - all combined with the classic noir cinematography of isolated brightness within the darkness of the underworld ( literally ) . damon in the flesh might seem a little out of place with his expensive clothes and perfectly - groomed features , but his narration is what brings it all together . he never sounds like he \\' s reading from a script , nor that he \\' s trying to embellish anything , it just comes natural to him . the screenwriters use the right words and phrases to describe the mood , from the smell of the air , to the logic involved in reading the other guys \\' faces and cards , and all without sounding remotely trite . immediately we get the sense that poker isn \\' t for gamblers , but for near - geniuses with nerves of steel . the game is a quiet war , with strategies just as complex and the same sense of honor among the soldiers . the gangsters mike plays against are the same ones that might kill someone for scratching their car , but when it comes to the game of poker , all respect is due to the winner because he is truly the better man . the film does an excellent job in establishing its atmosphere during the first act . it concentrates so much in this aspect that the background and the progression of the story stumble a bit . we learn only a little about mike , both past and present . presently we know he has a girlfriend named jo ( gretchen mol ) who he constantly argues with over his gambling . they go through a few break - up / make - up cycles until mike \\' s childhood pal and fellow rounder \" worm \" ( norton ) is released from prison . it \\' s not at all surprising worm owes thousand of dollars to the mob , but what is surprising is how the film is able to take such a predictable element and execute it the way it does . technically , the plot isn \\' t unlike many children \\' s sitcoms in which the \" good \" kid \\' s \" bad \" friend gets the good kid in trouble and yet the good kid remains friends with the bad kid . what this film does is use a different medium to tell that story . mike and worm have been in over their heads their entire lives , but both share a passion for out - thinking the other player who is trying to do the same to them . where as worm prefers to go the sleazy route of cheating ( hence his jail time ) , mike always takes the cards he \\' s dealt and works with them . sometimes they pay off ( i . e . his ability to pay his way through law school on his gambling money ) , but other times they don \\' t ( i . e . the fact he takes himself out of the game and works a steady job after dropping $ 30 , 000 on a single hand ) . once things start happening the film is able to expand and develop its plot into an intricate web of detail and mood . mike and worm bob and weave through all kinds of games at all kinds of places , from socialites \\' mansions , to taking the tourists at atlantic city , to outwitting the gangsters that control it all . everything they come into contact with is a big poker game in that everything \\' s a battle against the cards destiny deals . one scene demonstrates this perfectly in which mike is told by a judge ( martin landou , in a perfectly cast and performed role ) that destiny is everything and yet nothing at the same time . matt \\' s good at gambling but he \\' s also got potential to be a great lawyer . he could go professional as either , but with one he could lose everything or win big , but with the other there \\' s stability but not much risk involved . can someone who \\' s gambled his entire life really cash in his chips and leave ? if the film had been just a subtle lesson in poker - playing , then the ending is our test . everything is told from mike \\' s perspective , but we \\' re finally able to recognize some things on our own . this makes the final , against - all - odds showdown seem like just that . it works just like the game it revolves around - showing us some of the cards , but still evokes the element of the unknown , and the consequences thereof . what separates \" rounders \" from most other films about games is the fact the challenge and the skills are more important than winning in the end .',\n",

              " ('since director steven zaillian previously wrote the powerful screenplay for 1993 \\' s steven spielberg drama \" schindler \\' s list \" and directed 1993 \\' s intelligent \" searching for bobby fischer , \" his new film , \" a civil action , \" should most likely be looked upon as an unfortunate misstep in an otherwise prosperous career . what doesn \\' t make sense is how such high - profile and superb actors as john travolta , robert duvall , william h . macy , and kathleen quinlan got involved in this project , which is both dull and completely ineffective . the film , which involves a small community of children who mysteriously died of leukemia , certainly contains the type of story to be emotionally - charged , but somehow all signs of feeling have been completely removed from the proceedings , leaving us with nothing more than a poorly - done courtroom drama . based on a book by jonathan hart , which was consequently based on a true account , \" a civil action \" is set in 1982 in the town of woburn , mass . , where personal injury lawyer jan schlictmann ( john travolta ) decides to take on the case of eight families who simply want an apology for their children \\' s death from leukemia due to unknown causes . jan originally decides to drop the case , but when he stumbles across to corporate giants , grace and beatrice foods , who have plants located near the families \\' homes , he sees all of the pieces suddenly fall into place : the two companies have been leaking harmful chemicals into the nearby lake which , thus , goes into the city \\' s drinking water . suddenly , after hearing about the families \\' heartbreak and personal stories , he begins to care for them and becomes determined to get to the bottom of the mystery , even though he is warned by his staff accountant ( william h . macy ) that no money is coming in to them , only going out . also figuring into the story is jerome facher ( robert duvall ) , beatrice foods \\' corporate counsel , who finds himself in heated waters when jan will not accept his $ 20 - million offer to settle the case . coming from such a talented writer , director , and cast , not to mention one of the most interesting film composers , danny elfman , \" a civil action \" is an astoundingly empty - headed drama , one that includes an intriguing story and somehow transforms it into an admittedly tiresome and occasionally even boring experience . perhaps one of its major problems was that in its attempts to be a relatively uncommercial motion picture , zaillian has misplaced its refreshing unconventional attitude with an absence of magnetism and even meaning . watching the film , i couldn \\' t help but notice its similarities with 1997 \\' s far , far superior film \" the sweet hereafter , \" which dealt with a lawyer , played brilliantly by ian holm , investigating a school bus accident that killed a number of children . in his attempts to find someone who may have been responsible for the accident , holm interviews the grieving parents , as well as the sole surviving passenger , a teenage girl , which starts to remind him of his own teenage daughter , a young drug - addict who has run away from home . not only was the plotting similar to \" a civil action , \" but it also had the same exact running time of 115 minutes . considering this , it is amazing how fulfilling and truthful \" a sweet hereafter \" was , not only concentrating on the school bus accident , but delving deeply into ian holm \\' s character and his own personal demons , as well as the teenage girl . in \" a civil action , \" however , i have no idea where the running time went , since the film is virtually two hours of nothingness . we do not get to know the parents very well , nor any of the main characters . through its whole duration , i did not learn one thing__not one thing__about travolta \\' s lawyer character , jan schlictmann , who doesn \\' t appear to have any sort of life or purpose outside of his job . every scene is tediously related directly to the premise , and therefore , there was no one for me to care about or root for . you \\' ve got to work pretty hard , actually , to not get an audience to become involved in the parents \\' plight , since their children are dead , but that is exactly what \" a civil action \" does . to be honest , i would be fairly hard - pressed to state an aspect of the film that i actually liked . aside from one flashback to when a man \\' s young son died on the way to the doctor , i remained unmoved and passive about what was going on in the scenes , and more than once found my mind wandering . i could say the performances were good , but who \\' s fooling who ? since every character is one - dimensionally written , no one \\' s acting abilities are challenged in any way . travolta plays a lawyer well enough , but that \\' s about all he does . duvall virtually sleepwalks through his role , apparently only appearing to give one - liners at every chance he gets . and what in the world is kathy bates doing in the picture \\' s final scene , as a judge ? she appears unbilled , since it is just a cameo , but why did she even agree to do it in the first place ? finally , when the conclusion arrived and the end credits began to role , the film left me with another question : what was the point ? abruptly ending without any susceptible momentum , where none came before that to begin with , \" a civil action \" seemed to me , at least , to be an example of how not to make a courtroom drama , and it certainly did not do justice to the very serious subject matter the film deals with .',\n",

\" apparently jake sees the ghosts of dead people , but unlike \" the sixth sense , \" this young child isn \\' t the focus of the picture . instead , tom witzy ( kevin bacon ) , a chicago lineman , is our protagonist . jake is his son , and maggie ( kathryn erbe ) , whom has just discovered she is six weeks pregnant , is his hard - working wife . one night while at a party with their closest friends , tom convinces maggie \\' s new - age sister , lisa ( illena douglas ) , to try and hypnotize him . it unexpectedly works , and before long , tom is seeing things he wouldn \\' t normally see , including a deceased teenage girl ( jenny morrison ) in his house who happens to have been missing for the last six months . seeking help from lisa , she tells him that , while he was under hypnosis , she told him that after he awoke , his mind will remain clear and free , like an opened door . she didn \\' t expect it to work , but it did , and the only way to stop it is for tom to somehow find a way to help this girl he sees . \" stir of echoes \" isn \\' t a perfect film by any stretch of the imagination , but in the thick , atmospheric mood it conjures up , it is a terrifically eerie domestic horror - drama , and is not only effective on a technical level , but is impressive in its portrayal of a struggling working - class family . kevin bacon and , especially , kathryn erbe ( 1997 \\' s \" dream with the fishes \" ) , are top - notch and exceedingly believable as a loving married couple who nonetheless have their fair share of problems . after tom is hypnotized and starts seeing ghastly visions , he is completely taken over by his desire to solve this mystery of the disappearing girl whom he has seen lurking in his house , and instead of maggie not being understanding , she instead believes what tom says , and aside from being a little worried by what he is going through , does not try to stop his pursuit . bacon and erbe are not traditional hollywood stars like tom cruise and julia roberts , and therefore , are easier to relate to and always plausible as a struggling couple who have to work overtime at their jobs just to make ends meet . in a masterfully - done , entrancing sequence , tom is hypnotized by lisa , but instead of watching him , we instead see what he sees , starting from his view as he closes his eyes into darkness . lisa tells him to visualize being in an empty movie theater , and so , we , as audience members , are watching a movie screen from inside a theater , which is also showing a movie screen in a theater . telling him to move closer and closer to the screen as a fuzzy word in black letters pops up on the screen , we begin to float closer and closer to the front of the theater until we see that the word is \" sleep . \" never before have i seen a hypnotism scene as mesmerizing and brilliantly - construed as this one . truthfully , this set - piece , and another in which tom wakes up from a nightmarish dream only to quickly discover he is reliving what he has just dreamt , are worth the full price of admission alone , just to see them on the big screen . having loads of fun with her small role as maggie \\' s sister , lisa , illeana douglas ( 1995 \\' s \" to die for , \" her last great character ) is a delight , but rarely used to her full advantage in feature films . funny and enjoyably offbeat , douglas gets to utter the best line in the film : while talking to maggie about tom \\' s visions of the girl , she remarks , \" i wouldn \\' t be worried about him seeing another girl , although the fact that she \\' s dead gives one pause . \" also of note are jenny morrison ( 1994 \\' s \" intersection \" ) , who is truly poignant in the last half of the film when we flash back to see what really happened to her missing character , and liza weil , remarkable in 1998 \\' s \" whatever , \" as morrison \\' s grieving teenage sister , debbie . if the resolution of \" stir of echoes \" does not live up to its obviously frightful full potential ( and it doesn \\' t ) , what comes before is both involving and appropriately gritty . the music score , by james newton howard , and unsettling use of whispers and ghostly sound effects , successfully compliment and foreshadow the off - kilter frame - of - mind that tom is put into , and director david koepp proves once again that he is a director with a knack for creating almost unbearably tense situations that revolve around realistically - written characters . \" stir of echoes \" isn \\' t as good as \" the sixth sense , \" but why should it need to be ? both films are fully capable of standing on their own two feet , and \" stir of echoes \" really is a spinetinglingly good horror film .',\n",

( the title is taken from brooks \\' wish that nasa would send a payload of hundreds of expendable robots to scurry about the martian surface , creating a sort of road map for the terrain -- fast , cheap , and out of control . ) with able assists from editors karen schmeer and shondra merrill and cinematographer robert richardson ( oliver stone \\' s longtime collaborator ) , this becomes a cinematic contraption that \\' s a wonder of narrative divergence and coherence . ( further enhancing the picture \\' s wacky intellectual mood is the playful score by alloy orchestra founder caleb sampson . ) different story threads inform and comment on one another with the serene inscrutability of a kieslowski film , or a surrealist dream . by cobbling together out of these motley musings a thesis on the nature of craftsmanship , invention , and existence itself , morris reveals the presence of cosmic themes -- creation , evolution , death -- in earthbound lives . at the same time , and just as significantly , he pays tribute to a consuming passion for one \\' s work . this breakdown of the dichotomy between the everyday and the extraordinary is likely as profound as anything you \\' ll encounter in pop culture this year , and the visuals cry out for the big screen . don \\' t miss it . -------------------------------------------------------------- directed by errol morris edited by karen schmeer and shondra merrill cinematography by robert richardson music by caleb sampson u . s . , 1997 --------------------------------------------------------------',\n",

              " ('it is simply amazing how \" the green mile \" developed in its three hour running time . based on the stephen king series of the same title , the film starts out painfully slow , with underdeveloped characters and idiotic dialogue . however , as the plot begins to progress , the film turns into pure perfection with outstanding performances and wonderful direction . frank darabont , who masterfully followed a prisoner \\' s story in \" the shawshank redemption \" , this time follows the perspective of a prison guard , paul edgecomb ( tom hanks ) . through edgecomb \\' s experiences on a cell block known as the green mile where death row prisoners wait and repent , the audience sees good and evil on both sides of the law . from an evil prison guard to an evil prisoner , \" the green mile \" is successful in creating sympathy for kind - hearted hard working guards and hard thinking prisoners . the plot follows edgecomb and four other guards as they meet a variety of prisoners and after having strong relationships with each eventually are forced to execute them . the performances by veterans and new comers to back up these original characters are superb . the ensemble acting in the film is perfect . hanks , david morse and barry pepper as guards are wonderful and are fitting for their roles . they are the characters we most relate to because of their calm less extreme roles . they are given the positions to make rational decisions at difficult times and they are the ones who fulfill the demands of the audience . the more unique characters perfectly create friction on the green mile and make the story interesting and exciting . some particularly note worthy roles of the unique characters include doug hutchinson , sam rockwell , and michael duncan . hutchinson , playing percy wetmore , a cowardly guard who hides his true feelings by tormenting others gives the greatest performance of the movie . every time he appears on the screen , the attitude of others is very uncomfortable and the creepy expressions he is able to create are effectively terrifying . it would come as no surprise if hutchinson was nominated for an academy award as best supporting actor , not only because he did a wonderful job as wetmore , but also because he stole every scene he was in away from veteran oscar winner tom hanks . rockwell , an independent film veteran , plays his role as wild bill wharton to perfection . as a prisoner who taunts and harasses the guards at all hours , he really gets under your skin and irritates you for having to watch him torture others . this irritation he creates makes his performance so believable . the last noteworthy performance belongs to duncan , as the enormous convicted killer john coffey who happens to hold the power of curing the ill . duncan does a wonderful job playing a frightened child - like behemoth , very similar to lennie small in of mice and men . his desire for love and the extinction of hate evokes the most compassion because it is very obvious that he is suffering for no just cause . his pain creates pain for the viewer . however , it takes over an hour for duncan to be introduced completely in the film . the film opens with a ridiculous present day setting which contains a scene that jabs at \" the jerry springer show . \" the scene , containing one old man complaining about how all guests on the show are inbred and rednecks . not only is this observation entirely pointless and out of place , but it is also hackneyed beyond all belief . as the film flashes back to 1935 , graham greene is quickly executed without any introduction . his death seems very rushed and without any knowledge of who he is , the scene is neither sad nor convincing . greene is not even given a final word , like some of the other characters , and we don \\' t even see him walk the infamous green mile . however , as the film begins to specifically introduce more characters , such as coffey and eduard delacroix ( michael jeter ) as well as the five prison guards , the film becomes more interesting . the speed in \" the green mile \" is perfect . if time was a matter of concern and the film was edited to the two hour mark , it would have been unsatisfactory because we would not be able to know the characters as they are or as they treat others . the three hour running is perfect for plot development and by the end of the film , a great amount of love or hate is attached to each character . \" the green mile \" is so good following the rough beginning , that when the pivotal moment at the very end finally comes , it is almost impossible not to feel some sort of sadness for every person in this scene . fighting back tears was a difficult task that i barely succeeded in doing . if you survive the first third of \" the green mile \" sit back and enjoy the remainder for some priceless entertainment .',\n",

              " (\"once upon a time jean - claude van damme was a decent action hero . the muscles from brussels bursted into the hollywood market with mindless adventure films , boasting his spectacular martial - arts ability . some of these excursions were fun . but now it seems like watching a van damme movie has become a painful chore , with no rewards but the virtually guaranteed helping of mind - numbing action . and when the action goes sour , what is there left to enjoy ? i ' ll explain . knock off is about a pair of counterfeit jeans salesmen working out of an office in hong kong . marcus ray ( van damme ) , a babe - magnet and stylish dresser , heads up the company with an annoying weasel of a partner ( rob schneider ) . they become part of a plot involving microbombs implanted in counterfeit jeans , seemingly by a mole in the business . i ' m going to reveal about everything in the next paragraph , so if you want a review devoid of spoilers , skip onto the next one . i ' m not quite sure who gives a crap , but i ' ll issue a warning anyhow . tommy is really working with the cia . his boss ( a very hammy and flat paul sorvino ) is the mole , and he wants to cause carnage with these tiny but immensely powerful super weapons . he even stoops so low to put them into children ' s toys . if you thought this plot outline sounded intriguing , then you probably will enjoy knock off . if you think that this ridiculous set - up couldn ' t even fill five minutes of screen time without causing you to roll over laughing , this might not be your cup of tea . knock off sucks . it stoops to ridiculous levels that most individuals could only conjure up in horrific nightmares . it amazes me how far these producers will go to sell something , simply because van damme is the star . the plot is pathetic garbage strung together by inane action sequences that will baffle your mind , the performances are so wooden you could use them to row a canoe , and the action itself is an absolute catastrophe . director tsui hark ( who teamed with van damme in the superior , but still lame - brained double team ) is at the helm , and he would rather attempt to dazzle us with fantastic camera angles than engage us with the plot . i suppose i enjoyed some of the camera work , but the incessant desperation of it all made me rather nauseous . the picture freezes in the middle of an action sequence , speeds are altered consistently , and the camera tricks mostly apply to traveling up gun barrels as the weapons are fired . it all sounds very cool . trust me , it isn ' t . as much as it scars me to say this ( har , har ) , van damme is terrible . sure , he does lots of fancy kickboxing moves and dodges giant crates with the greatest of ease . he looks like he ' s doing a bad impersonation of jackie chan , and his performance is stiff and tired . i hate to say it , but perhaps it ' s time for mr . van damme to give up his day job . it ' s really a test of endurance watching knock off . i suppose there ' s some enjoyment derived from schneider ' s character , who is extremely annoying , but provides the film ' s better moments . and what is the beautiful lela rochon doing in this movie ? hopefully she grabbed her paycheck and then fled the premises like an olympic sprinter . knock off doesn ' t even stand strong as a mindless but entertaining action film , like a handful of van damme ' s others . no , this movie is an embarrassment to the entire action genre of modern filmmaking . and considering how low hollywood has stooped as of late in that department , that is certainly not saying much . note to self : avoid universal soldier 2 : the return upon release in august ? 99 .\",\n",

              " (\"let me start off by saying that leading up to the release of the latest bond film , i really wasn ' t looking forward to it as much as i have with some of the previous films . i ' m not sure if it was the fairly lackluster trailers or the ever - present dread that the next film will fall back into the miserable ways of the timothy dalton years . i ' m happy to report that any doubts were erased after about the first 10 minutes of the film . by that point , it was evident that mr . bond was back with a vengeance . all doubts would have probably been erased sooner except for the fact that the first ten minutes of the film weren ' t exactly a pleasant experience . it seems that nobody told the geniuses working at the theater that the house lights are supposed to be turned off when the movie starts . it took a reminder from an audience member to clue them in . i guess they can be excused though , taking tickets and cleaning up popcorn between shows is extremely taxing on the brain . anyway , after somebody remembered what the light switch was for , i settled in for bond . i think the most noticeable aspect of this , the 19th film in the series , is that it really goes back to the almost tongue in cheek style of the roger moore films . there were probably more one - liners in this movie than in the last several combined . and bond ' s last one - liner in the film is about the best of the series . the world is not enough also contained perhaps the most action of any movie of the series . everything from wild boat chases to the usual assortment of cool bond gadgets trotted out just when there seems to be no way out for 007 . for the most part , the action sequences worked very well . although , there were a couple of times that i thought some things were a bit over the top , even for a bond film . i think some of the blame can be laid at the feet of director michael apted . while he did a good job for the most part , there were points in the movie , specifically during action sequences , that he seemed to loose site of the fact that he was making essentially an action film . most noticeably sequences on a snow covered mountain and one involving bond getting through a closing door looked like apted thought he was filming some sort of high brow art movie . he almost seemed like he didn ' t know what he was doing . but they were brief scenes and really shouldn ' t take away from the otherwise solid job that apted did in directing . if you have ever seen a bond film , you won ' t be shocked to learn that plot has never been their strong suit . the world is not enough is no exception . this time we have yet another over villain that bond has to stop for the good of the world . 007 matches wits with the terrorist renard ( robert carlyle ) , a man who has a bullet lodged in his brain that makes him impervious to pain . why this point is included is beyond me . they took great pains to explain his condition , but it only came up later in the movie as a scene that can only be described as looking like an afterthought . anyway , renard , like the typical terrorist that he is , is bent on some harebrained scheme involving a mid - east oil pipeline . i guess world domination just isn ' t as attractive to terrorists as a money making venture anymore . bond is brought in to protect the pipeline ' s owner , elektra king ( sophie marceau ) , who is the daughter of one of renard ' s recent victims . along the way , bond has to enlist the help of a nuclear scientist , dr . christmas jones ( denise richards ) , and his old rival valentin zukovsky ( robert carlyle ) . like all bond films , you basically just have to suspend disbelief over the plot , since it is ridiculous beyond words . my biggest complaint would be that it was about the most disjointed of any of the bond films . there was at least one point that i had to stop and try to remember why bond was where he was and why he was doing what he was doing . the buddy that i saw the movie with was completely confused over an earlier kidnapping of marceau ' s character . it was alluded to earlier in the movie briefly -- although not included in the film . later , it became a big part of the story and left him with the distinct feeling that he had missed something . but because it is a bond film , the beautiful women and nifty gadgets seem to make you forget about script problems quite quickly . after all , it isn ' t shakespeare . how about the cast ? brosnan seems to get better with each of his appearances as 007 . i grew up with the roger moore version of bond , so i really enjoyed the lighter style that brosnan brings to the character . judi dench , as m , had a bigger role in this film than in her two previous appearances in the role . she brought the talent with her that one would expect from an oscar winner . robbie coltrane was easily one of the best parts in goldeneye , so it was nice to see his russian mobster character revived in this movie . coltrane gets more screen time , which simply leads to him stealing even more scenes . then there are the bond girls . sophie marceau might be one of the most beautiful actresses working today . there is just something about her breathtaking eyes that makes her a natural to play the innocent victim . those that saw her in braveheart know she is more than just a pretty face . marceau may be the most talented actress to ever play a bond love interest . then we have denise richards . there was no doubt in my mind that she was cast exclusively for her looks . and after you see the outfits she wears , you won ' t have any trouble guessing what part of her anatomy caught the producer ' s eyes . i was pleasantly surprised to find that she really did a good job playing a nuclear scientist . admittedly , there was one point that the audience snickered a bit at one of her technical lines of dialogue , but other than that she stacks up ( no pun intended ) to her bond girl predecessors nicely . i must say that the biggest disappointment was robert carlyle ' s character . while carlyle did a fine job with the material that he had , his character just never worked for me . the producers tried very hard to add more complexity to his character , but it just never quite got off the ground . i guess i was hoping for a bit more regarding the whole impervious to pain aspect of his character , but the writers decided to play up the emotional side of his character . this might have worked well in another movie , but i don ' t go to see bond movies for their deep characterizations . last , but not least , we have desmond llewelyn as q . this is the 17th appearance for llewelyn as bond ' s gadget guy , and he is as good as ever . although his screen time has grown far more limited in the past few films , he is still a treat to watch . rumors abound that this may be his last appearance in the role . he says future appearances are up to a higher power . the producers have introduced his protege and future replacement , a bumbling and somewhat pompous character played by comedy master john cleese . while we don ' t see much of him in this film , i think it is fair to say that desmond llewelyn ' s legacy , whenever it is passed on , will be in very capable hands . so how does it stack up ? despite some problems , the world is not enough is a very entertaining movie . and , all things considered , what problems it does have are small compared to some that have plagued earlier bond movies . this is easily the best of the brosnan films . it may even be the best of the entire series , certainly in the top 3 . one thing is for sure , even after 19 movies , there is still plenty of life left in the james bond series . here ' s looking forward to bond number 20 .\",\n",

              " ('zero effect gets its title from the main character , daryl zero ( bill pullman ) , although we don \\' t understand what it truly means until the very last line of dialogue in the film . zero is a private investigator , perhaps the best private investigator who ever lived ( at least he \\' d like to think so ) . however , he \\' s a socially inept being , and eccentric in every possible way -- this fact certainly makes his talents as a private eye even more bewildering than they already are . zero \\' s accomplice is steve arlo ( ben stiller ) , a \" normal \" guy who does the business side of the job -- he \\' s the one who actually speaks to clients and explains zero \\' s greatness as an investigator . the opening scene has steve explaining the many virtues of zero \\' s talents to soon - to - be client gregory stark ( ryan o \\' neal ) . it turns out that stark has lost a key to a safe deposit box , and is now being blackmailed for something that he apparently knows nothing about . zero takes the case , and the plot thickens . his path leads to a young , pretty paramedic named gloria sullivan ( kim dickens ) . despite her luminous and seemingly - harmless presence , she turns out to be the one blackmailing stark . through his investigations , zero learns why , but not without developing feelings for gloria -- feelings that , because of his reclusive behavior , are new and confusing to him . i have no particular affinity towards the mystery genre of film . i can idly enjoy movies about private investigators , and , every once in a while , a film like chinatown comes a long that blows me away ( actually , no private eye film has ever reached chinatown \\' s greatness ) . zero effect , which is jake kasdan \\' s first effort as writer / director , is a film about a private investigator that succeeds in all attempts : it \\' s an original , funny , and completely involving motion picture . with so many cliches available to this genre , i find it amazing that kasdan avoided all of them . but he didn \\' t just successfully avoid flaws : he has created a great film here , one that had me interested and fascinated from the first shot to the final moment . take , for starters , the great cast of characters . pullman is terrific as zero , showing a comic flair that i really haven \\' t seen from him since spaceballs . zero is the kind of guy who seems at ease switching personalities so frequently as he does here ; the fact that he \\' s an almost exaggeratedly twisted , emotionally unstable man outside of his profession is not at all difficult to believe . pullman \\' s performance is much more layered than it might seem at first glance , and the occasional voice - over as he \\' s going through the motions of his job are insightful and often hilarious . ben stiller is also a very funny individual ; he \\' s the kind of comedian who makes normal lines sound funny . \" i \\' ll shoot you , \" he says to stark at one point . \" i have a gun , and everything . \" his character is also well - drawn , with an interesting subplot involving his girlfriend ( angela featherstone ) who is not happy with the extensive amounts of time he must spend away from her due to the unpredictability of his job . o \\' neal also gives his character a bit of depth ; and kim dickens , last seen ( and underused ) in mercury rising , gets a chance to show us her talent here , giving gloria the realism this kind of character really needs . i find zero effect to be an immensely funny and witty film . kasdan \\' s humor is of the best kind -- soft spoken , and mostly dialogue - driven ( though there are some great visual jokes ) . it \\' s the kind of humor that \\' s funny even after you \\' ve seen it five or six times . there \\' s one scene in which zero talks about how detached he is , an how that makes him such a great detective . what we see during this narration are various shots of him sitting on a bed , or standing motionlessly , with his hair destroyed and an utterly blank look painted on his unshaven face , his eyes pointing to something off camera , but obviously to nothing in particular . i can \\' t convey to you how funny this is , but what makes it great film making is that it has a point -- scenes like this are frequent , and they provide solid characterization of zero . as a side note , i don \\' t consider myself an average viewer when it comes to comedy ( not to sound elitist ) -- i find things funny that many do not , and vice versa . there was a clump of people near me in the theater laughing uproariously through this film , and the rest of the theater was relatively silent through most of it . i have a feeling the humor here won \\' t appeal to everyone , but there \\' s certainly enough story and character development to keep anyone \\' s interest . jake kasdan , son of writer / director lawrence kasdan , is only 22 years old . i found this out after seeing the film , and i can \\' t remember ever being so impressed with a film maker . his direction is stylish without being pretentious , and his writing is mature , full , and developed . zero effect is the kind of film that i \\' ll buy for my collection -- smart , original films like this are rare as it is , but this one actually has a heart and a soul . at the end of the film , i was involved in the characters , and i was satisfied with the outcome . and , with kasdan \\' s undeniable talent at such a young age , all i can do is hope to see a lot more from him in the future .',\n",

( diedre \\' s therapist wishes to have her recommitted , so she decides to visit diedre , alone , in her new apartment -- never realizing , of course , that it \\' s not her \\' s . therapists typically are catatonically brain - dead in these movies ) . having successfully snuffed the woman out , diedre looks at the body and says : \" what was it that you always said to me at the end of each session , dr . jones ? oh , that \\' s right . \\' i \\' m sorry , but your time is up ! \\' \" this is what passes for humor in the film . the audience doesn \\' t necessarily laugh but groan ( the type of groan that suggests the audience can \\' t believe they \\' re watching this crap -- although watching it they are ) . nick mancuso \\' s chainsmoking , nervous - wreck character does not have the cheesy lines that butler \\' s character delivers , but his ridiculously overdone performance provides for some better comic relief . in between drags off his cigarette , for instance , in one of the movie \\' s best scenes , david tries to explain to his lawyer what a creep his ex - wife is . in exaggerated exasperation , he nearly shouts \" the woman is a cuckoo - bird ! \" ( trust me , it is funny in context . ) and so , the movie continues until its painfully obvious conclusion . i won \\' t reveal the ending specifically ( though anyone remotely familiar with thrillers of this type could probably guess the ending just from this film review ) , but i will say that the ex has one of the biggest fire hazards appearing recently in film . molly and david own a cabin that becomes engulfed by flames in approximately three seconds ! molly , at one point in the film , not - so - brilliantly observes , after discovering diedre has moved into an apartment across from her family \\' s to spy upon them , that \" she \\' s crazy . \" you \\' d be pretty crazy too if you \\' d rented this turkey . i \\' d avoid it unless it \\' s on tv and you come across it . if you do , you may want to watch it , groan at the bad punchlines and stupid plot , and feel good that you didn \\' t spend money renting it .',\n",

( while we \\' re at it , put that visor back on laforge ! ) for three hundred years , the ba \\' ku species ( who look just like humans ) have lived on a ringed - planet that might as well be called the fountain of youth . six hundred of them occupy the briar patch , the area affected by metaphasic radition , a positive energy that reverses the aging process in the elderly . but evil ru \\' afo ( this is probably abraham \\' s last stop before performing \" amadeus \" at a dinner theatre near you ) , leader of the son \\' a ( who look just like burn victims after reconstructive surgery ) , wants to relocate the ba \\' ku and movie his people onto the briar patch in their place , in order to replenish his dying breed . the federation is all for this , but picard feels this is a direct violation of the prime directive : to not interfere with the development of an alien race . ( never mind that the ba \\' ku didn \\' t exactly evolve - they went wandering in the universe one day and stumbled upon the magic world . ) every time frakes gives an interview lately , he seems to top whatever ludicrous statement he last gave regarding this installment . he has called it a comedy , a thinking man \\' s picture , a throwback to the old series , and , most grievously , he has likened it to a john ford western . ( i presume that \\' s some john ford he went to school with , not the director of the searchers . ) he has also gone on record as saying paramount recut the film from his version . that \\' s no excuse - someone generated this footage . muddy cinematography and sitcom sets are the least of its problems ; star trek : insurrection appears to have been beamed in from the planet plotholia . consider such curiosities . . . picard \\' s love interest , anij ( donna murphy ) , can slow things down by staring at them ( such as a waterfall or falling rocks ) - her scientific explanation for this ? \" don \\' t ask . \" worf gets a pimple ( he \\' s re - experiencing klingon puberty thanks to the time - defying atmosphere ) , laforge regains his eyesight ( trust me , levar burton \\' s real eyes are scarier than those electronic lenses he wore in first contact ) and troi brags about her firm boobs , but picard remains as bald as an android \\' s butt . most suspiciously , what exactly is the problem with letting this endangered race have a little fun in the sun ? the filmmakers cloud the issue with some nonsense about a family feud of sorts , and they also turn ru \\' afo into a completely power - mad superfreak , just so the characters will have something to do in the climax . ( and if you \\' ve seen return of the jedi , you \\' ve seen the ending of this movie . ) didn \\' t picard himself previously disobey the prime directive when he prevented the borg from assimilating millions ? frakes lucked out with first contact , and repeat viewings of that film reveal the seeds of what went wrong in his direction of insurrection : he has no sense of comic timing , and he mines for acting chemistry where none exists . ( take a look at the painful \" troi gets drunk \" scene in fc and you \\' ll get the general idea of insurrection \\' s unsuccessfully jokey and hollow tone . ) even the worst shatner and co . treks , like the final frontier , maintained a watchability thanks to the effortless , charming comaraderie between kirk , spock , and bones . neither first contact nor insurrection has any idea what to do with crusher ( gates mcfadden , whom i must say maintains a fabulous physique ) , troi , or laforge . and all three next generation films spend too much time on data , who is the franchise \\' s answer to urkel . need a cheap laugh ? have data say something sexual , or start singing , or lift up a four hundred pound boulder as if it \\' s the hunk of styrofoam it really is . here \\' s my proposed title for number 10 : data star data trek : data data data data data . in this movie , data will become preoccupied with learning to blow his nose , while crusher and troi watch silently from 500 yards away and laforge points his sinister gaze at the android in doubly robotic observation . star trek : insurrection had one nice , eerie , silent moment that hints at a better , darker film . i \\' m not saying all of them should be star trek ii : the wrath of khan , but this one boldly went where no movie should go again .',\n",

              " (\"in the grand scheme of mel gibson movies , payback was better than conspiracy theory , but not as good as braveheart or lethal weapon . in other words , it ' s a decent couple of hours of entertainment , but 20 years from now if a they compile a list of mel gibson ' s greatest hits , payback probably won ' t be on it . gibson plays a crook who gets double crossed by his partner after they heist a payroll . mel ' s partner needed the money to pay off a mob debt . so he puts a couple of bullets in mel , leaving him for dead , and goes on to pay off his creditors . but , mel isn ' t dead ( it would be a real short movie if he was ) and he certainly isn ' t happy . to make matters worse , he wants his money back and is willing to go to any lengths to accomplish this feat . his ex partner has already used it to pay off the mobsters , so mel goes after the mob to get it back . payback is often a very violent film . to its credit , there are a few scenes that could have been very graphic , but the director ( i ' m not sure which one -- more about that in a second ) made the choice to let the audience use their imagination instead of subjecting us to the usual gratuitous gore found in many films . the film appears a bit disjointed in places , which is understandable considering producer / star gibson wasn ' t thrilled with how the film turned out and wanted parts of it re - shot . when the director refused , another one was brought in to do the re - shoot . so as a result while the final product is apparently better than the original ( although personally i would love to see the original version for comparisons sake ) it does get a bit of a choppy feel to it towards the end . it ' s always tough to make a film where the main character is a villain , unless that person has some redeeming qualities . in this case , gibson ' s character has few redeeming qualities . but hey , its mel , so even when he is killing people in cold blood we are still rooting for him . my guess is that if that you put some other johnny bananas actor in this role , the audience would not be quite as responsive . gibson is gibson , whether he is playing a suicidal cop or a stone cold killer , he does a good job . he almost guarantees that no matter what else happens in the rest of the movie at least the audience is going to get one good performance . this time out mel is surrounded by a good supporting cast , including maria bello ( as his love interest ) , william devane and kris kristofferson ( as mod bosses ) . the man who steals the show and unfortunately doesn ' t have a real big part is james coburn ( as yet another mobster ) . if i had one big disappointment in this film , it would be that coburn didn ' t have a bigger role . in the end , payback is a fairly solid action thriller , just not in quite the same league as some of mel gibson ' s other work .\",\n",

              " ('pulp fiction , quentin tarantino \\' s anxiously awaited and superb follow - up to reservoir dogs , is absolutely and without a doubt progressing as one of the most talked about , loved , and hated films of all - time . in all fairness , it should be noted that those who love this film greatly outnumber those who hate it . as if reservoir dogs wasn \\' t perfect , tarantino went ahead and improved on perfection by creating pulp fiction , a fast - paced , hard talking , roller coaster ride of a movie that combines violence and extraordinary dialogue in a seemingly perfect way . every major character in this film is represented by a terrific acting performance by the actor . to begin with , the two hit men : vincent vega ( john travolta ) and jules winnfield ( samuel l . jackson ) . these two characters work together perfectly , and the performances by each actor are nearly perfect . travolta , in fact , is still trying to get out of the vincent vega role . if these two characters were not enough , there \\' s the struggling boxer butch coolidge ( bruce willis ) , the two small - time criminals pumpkin ( tim roth ) and honey bunny ( amanda plummer ) , the big man in charge marsellus wallace ( ving rhames ) and his attractive young wife mia ( uma thurman ) , and the \" problem solver \" himself , the wolf ( harvey keitel ) . these are just the major characters . smaller roles , but equally terrific , are handed to jimmie ( quentin tarantino ) , a young married man who gets caught up in some serious gangster business , lance ( eric stoltz ) , the far - out drug dealer , as well as maynard ( duane whitaker ) and zed ( peter greene ) , two hillbillies who are the men \" behind \" ( no pun intended for those of you who have seen this ) a very disturbing scene towards the end of the film . the film interweaves three stories that , at first , seem to be nothing alike but later prove to be very critical to each other . the film begins with pumpkin and honey bunny in a small coffee shop discussing their recent robberies and hold - ups . the two quickly decide to hold up the coffee shop , unknowing of what lies ahead . after this , the film focuses for some time on vincent and jules and their hit man lifestyle . utilizing the films unforgettable dialogue , the two men discuss such things as hamburgers and foot massages before they bust into an apartment to terrorize the occupants . the two men were sent to the apartment to recover a mysterious briefcase for their boss , marsellus wallace . after basically toying with the men , especially the unfortunate brett ( frank whaley ) , vincent and jules complete their mission and recover the briefcase . this is not before a man jumps out from a bathroom with a . 357 \" hand cannon \" , shooting at the two gangsters . he somehow completely misses them , leading jules to cite divine intervention . this is also the basis for more of the now - famous tarantino dialogue . the film then shifts to focus on boxer butch coolidge and his boxing escapades . butch was ordered to take a fall in his latest fight , but when he does not , marsellus vows to find him , wherever he is , and make sure that butch is not able to enjoy his new fortune . vincent , meanwhile , has the honor of taking marsellus \\' wife , mia , out on a date while the big man is out of town . vincent , obviously , is rather nervous about this , especially after hearing the tale about a man who was thrown out of a window for supposedly giving mia a foot massage . after their date , which seems to rather smoothly , things take a turn for the worst at the hands of vincent \\' s high - priced heroin , dubbed a \" monster \" by lance . each story continually progresses , and new and amazing events occur . eventually , the stories all meet each other in the end , with pumpkin and honey bunny holding up the restaurant , which happens to contain both vincent and jules . pulp fiction is definitely one of the best films of the decade , and possibly of all - time . along with its superb dialogue , action , writing , directing , and acting , this film will not only latch onto you , but it proves that it does not want to release you until it has sunk its claws completely into you . and with most fans of this movie , this is proved to be a rather easy task , although at times the graphic images , violence , and language may seem a bit overpowering . surely , quentin tarantino \\' s fame was greatly escalated by this film , and he proves not to be one who will fade from existence very soon .',\n",

              " (\"modern audiences are more likely to be familiar with les misirables from the pop - broadway musical rather than victor hugo ' s original tome . adapted several times for the cinema , this latest effort does a superb job of translating the characters , story , and heart of the novel to the screen . liam neeson stars as jean valjean . as a young man , valjean stole some bread to satisfy his hunger . . . and he was sentenced to 19 years of hard labor for his crimes . prison hardened him , and on his release he seems doomed to a life of crime and squalor . however , an unexpected act of compassion changes his outlook on life , and he vows to become a better man . however , he runs up against one man who doesn ' t believe in reform . inspector javert ( geoffrey rush ) is an obsessive law abider . he has no tolerance for anyone who breaks the rules , even with benign intentions . he once served as a guard at the labor camp where valjean served , and after valjean breaks his parole , javert devotes himself to bringing him to justice . two women also get caught up in the struggle . fantine ( uma thurman ) is an unwed mother suffocating in an unforgiving society . her daughter , cosette ( mimi newman , and later , claire danes ) , is her life , yet she cannot afford to raise her . instead , cosette is sent to live with a cruel foster family which extorts money from fantine , and forces cosette into a life little better than a slave . director bille august manages to create a faithful adaptation of victor hugo ' s novel , which , though omitting some of the political undertones , remains true to the overall story and tone of the book . hopefully you won ' t , as some clueless members of the audience did , wonder where all the songs went . the movie manages to be completely engrossing without the andrew lloyd webber flourishes . the experience is bolstered by strong performances throughout , though neeson and rush deservedly take center stage with their core roles . neeson in particular deserves kudos for his portrayal of a man trying to do good , but continually haunted by his past . the supporting cast is also extraordinary . the only actor who dims in comparison is hans matheson , playing the revolutionary , marius . the film slightly loses its luster during his brief love affair , but it is transitory , and truly only distracting when contrasted with the rest of the film . the novel les misirables is , by any account , an epic , both in its scope and in its length . while it would be nearly impossible to cram everything from its pages into a two hour movie , this latest attempt does an admirable job at the translation . it , too , is an epic . . . and one worth seeing .\",\n",

what is truly disturbing is that with a great book , talented actors and a grand budget , this could have been so much more . pretty much like jan de bont ( \" twister \" , \" haunting \" ) , paul verhoven has never made anything extraordinary . he was responsible for several good films ( \" basic instinct \" and \" starship troopers ) \" and some incredibly bad films ( \" showgirls \" , \" total recall \" ) , but he has never made anything that was great . in a way \" hollow man \" fits perfectly in this collection . it \\' s not better or worse than verhoven \\' s average film . he proves once again that he is incapable of handling more complex issues . and so , instead of depth and chills , verhoven inserts some of his trademarks : stupid dialogue , and lot \\' s of dull action with blood and naked bodies . he even throws in some of the worst of film clich ? s - the slowly advancing fireball , the villain who comes back from the dead , etc , etc . - and tops the whole thing off with one of the most ridiculous endings of the year ( you \\' ll be screaming \" nooooo ! \" and attempt to run towards the exit in slow motion ) . and all we can ask is why ? the answer is simple . though hollywood is a movie producing machine , the business of moviemaking has to be about something more than money . it has to be about telling stories , not marketing them . it has to be about transporting us to a different place , to dazzle us with magic and cleverness . to make us care , to make us think and feel . verhoven has obviously missed that point and this film is a proof of that . it \\' s all flesh and bones , but no soul . a void where its imagination should be .',\n",

              " ('renown surrealist director , the 77 - year - old frenchman alain resnais ( hiroshima , mon amour / last year at marienbad / m ? lo ) , has created a lighthearted musical played as an homage to britisher dennis potter and his pennies from heaven ( 1978 tv serial , 1981 movie ) and the singing detective ( 1986 ) . the film follows potter \\' s gimmicky style of having the characters jump into lip - synched old or contemporary french pop songs to express their private thoughts . he also follows the kind of sweet and colorful musicals his fellow countryman jacques demy loved to direct , such as \" the umbrellas of cherbourg \" and \" the young girls of rochefort . \" the tale has resnais \\' s unique touches as a director to go along with his homage . it is a satire about class differences and falling in love with the wrong person , and that there is a song in everyone \\' s heart for every occasion . what hinders this production is that the stars are not portraying particularly engaging characters , the songs are not memorable and stand little chance of being recognized by an american audience ( the exceptions might be the edith piaf and maurice chevalier numbers ) , and the farce seems more banal than daring . yet it is not without its striking moments and charms , such as when jane birkin does a cameo and sings one of her own songs . also , the glossy amberlike photography added a very french romantic feeling to the story , while the mood of paris as being a place for love to flourish above all else , which has always been embellished in movie lore , comes through with flying colors . it also does a good job of showing you the way paris is in the 1990s and in the way ordinary people exist there . it tells the romantic story of six parisians who become intertwined with each other in their ordinary lives as they search for happiness . they are the attractive sisters odile ( sabine az ? ma ) and camille ( agnes jaoui ) , with the older businesswoman odile married and decidedly set on a bourgeois life of material comforts . she is married to the glum and laconic claude ( pierre arditi ) . she once went out with a businessman , nicolas ( jean - pierre bacri ) , who left her 8 - years ago and now shows up in paris and asks her help to find someone to rent a flat for his family . simon ( andre dussolier ) works as a real - estate salesman and is trying to find nicolas a flat , in his spare time he writes radio plays . simon \\' s boss is the much younger , unscrupulous and arrogant marc duveyrier ( lambert wilson ) , who inherited the firm from his father and is the real - estate agent selling a more luxurious and larger flat with a better view to odile , but fails to tell her that a building project is going up soon that will block her view . screenwriters and actors jean - pierre bacri and agnes jaoui wrote themselves the best parts . jaoui \\' s camille is a university scholar finishing up a ph . d . in history , using for her thesis the study of \\' the yeomen in the year 1000 at lake paladru . \\' she works as a tour guide in the meantime and suffers from panic attacks , even though she appears to have outwardly perfect self - control . on her tours for the last four years has been the much older simon , pretending to be doing research for his plays but really attracted to her , but not having the nerve to tell her this . to his dismay , he finds out she is dating his mean - spirited but handsome boss , whom she meets when looking at her sister \\' s new place and seeing him crying but not realizing that it was from a cold , not because he \\' s so sensitive . bacri as the classy nicolas , turns out to be now working as a chauffeur . he is a hypochondriac with a history of depression who visits many doctors , until he finds one who tells him there is nothing wrong with him . odile still pines for him , but he \\' s married , telling her he expects his wife to arrive shortly . love is \\' the same old song \\' that makes the world go \\' round , even when all the characters are liars and not exactly open to what their true motives are . everything comes together in a bourgeois housewarming party for odile \\' s place , as the characters reveal their true feelings and all their deceptions and neurotic impulses are either uncovered or about to be . there \\' s not a lot of bite to this satirical musical , but resnais has never made a bad film and is one of the best current french directors , if not the best . this film is not one his great ones , but it still has enough pep in its light touches to be interesting . it not only has an odd way for the characters to break into song but -- some males even sing in a female voice while some females sing in a male voice . it is also interesting in the way it examines its characters \\' behavior as being similar in business as in love .',\n",

( this is a bad omen for his next movie , \" the story of us , \" which chronicles the ups and downs of a marriage ) . writer / director m . night shyamalan has a light , poetic touch that goes to the heart of the viewer without seeming sappy or trite . he \\' s also a skillful storyteller , as the movie \\' s ending demonstrates . only when the final secret is revealed do you realize that shyamalan has been hinting at it throughout the movie . look for a cameo by the director as a doctor who treats cole . bottom line : osment should get an oscar nomination , and you should go see this movie .',\n",

( in addition , the film takes a bite into race - related issues , and never develops them at all . ) there are a lot of scenes like this one , and none of them are very coherent . there ' s also a considerable language barrier , given that chow and some of the other actors have thick chinese accents . the plot itself never straightens out . i ' m not sure who or what the fukienese dragons are , or why henry lee is associated with them , or what they do as a group . the corruptor is an action movie , and so all these weird plot developments are decorated with loud and violent action sequences . the sequences aren ' t bad , but they ' re not new ; how many car chases through chinatown have you seen ? on that note , how many chinatown cop movies have you seen ? one too many , i ' d imagine . foley ' s strength is clearly in characterization , and he does a pretty good job here . the scenes between nick and danny are very good , and i actually got a feel for their characters ; a bond forms between them that holds parts of the film together . chow and wahlberg are both good actors ; chow is a pro , and can do this kind of stuff in his sleep . wahlberg seems less at home in this atmosphere , but he ' s still fun to watch . i also liked the subplot involving danny ' s father ; brian cox ' s performance is powerful , and his character makes a compelling moral compass for danny . but the film ultimately fails , mostly at the hands of insane incoherence and overly - familiar action scenes . a complicated plot can be successful , but the story needs to make sense when it ' s over . the corruptor never manages to make any sense -- it just keeps spinning out of control until , finally , there ' s nothing left to hold on to .\",\n",

( think charlie and irene will fall in love ? yeah , me too . ) the farrellys then introduce scores of different characters , and none of them ever manage to do anything you haven \\' t already expected them to do , no matter how outrageous their actions might be . compared to the curveballs the farrellys are used to throwing , this stuff is almost entirely soft - tossed , presenting an obvious problem : when gross - out humor loses its shock value , it \\' s no longer funny , merely gross . the jokes that do work are milked over and over until their effectiveness runs dry . take , for example , the subplot involving charlie \\' s three black sons ( anthony anderson , mongo brownlee , jerod mixon ) . the incongruity of it all is funny for a while , with three burly black men discussing higher math in ghetto language and white - bread carrey mouthing said language with an entirely too - pleasant smile on his face . but by the end of the film , they \\' re still doing the same schitck it hasn \\' t been elevated to another , funnier level , and it hasn \\' t been dropped either . that \\' s too bad , because it ceases to be amusing about halfway through . \" me , myself & irene \" reeks of wasted opportunities . there ought to be more focus on how other people react to charlie \\' s new personality , and on how charlie deals with the consequences of hank \\' s actions . this doesn \\' t really happen nearly every supporting character learns about charlie \\' s condition early on , so they don \\' t have any opportunity to be surprised by it . the film throws what looks like a patented farrelly curve in a scene towards the midway point ( involving an albino companion charlie and irene pick up called , appropriately , \" whitey \" ) , but the script doesn \\' t go anywhere with it , instead leaving the thread twisting in the wind before awkwardly tying it up during the climax . jim carrey is a gifted comedian , both physically and vocally , but he \\' s left with nothing much to do here except contort himself in a manner similar to steve martin in \" all of me . \" it \\' s a great showcase of flexibility and split - second role - shifting , but none of it is terribly funny . carrey doesn \\' t pull any stunts we don \\' t expect him to pull , and the farrellys \\' script doesn \\' t give him anything else to pull : the situations in which he must perform the role - shifting aren \\' t set up in any meaningful way . perhaps carrey can take solace in the fact that his supporting actors fare no better . zellweger \\' s irene is not a strong female lead mary in \" mary \" may have been part adolescent fantasy , but she was also intelligent and strong - willed . irene is nothing in particular , as the film never makes clear whether she \\' s ditzy , clever , or neither . as such , she gives us nothing to latch onto as the only \" sane \" person in the film . chris cooper is stuck playing exactly one note as a corrupt fbi agent , and his character is entirely too straight - laced for a movie like this . he , like the others , does absolutely nothing unexpected . after viewing the shapeless mess that \" me , myself & irene \" eventually dissolved into , i was stuck wondering whether or not the farrellys had outsmarted themselves . maybe their kind of comedy can only work for so long until audiences get wise to it and stop being shocked . but i don \\' t believe it -- good filmmakers find ways of surprising their audiences even after people have grown attuned to their style . if the farrellys are indeed good , smart filmmakers ( and i still think they are ) , they \\' ll rebound just fine . even after that happens , though , i \\' ll still consider \" me , myself & irene \" to be a high - caliber misfire .',\n",

disney still hasn \\' t ditched ) . dean , for example , could have been a stereotypical beatnik ( his character profile seems to suggest that ) , but he is presented as a character with real emotions , thoughts , and motivations . even the heavy , agent mansley , is not a villain who does bad things simply because he wants to , but out of his own fear and paranoia . a lesser animated feature would have drawn up paper - thin stereotypes and figure the kids won \\' t mind , but \" the iron giant \" has clearly put a little work into making the characters real , and it pays off . the film isn \\' t only around to deliver heavy - handed messages , though . it \\' s also very funny , and the humor is of the kind that both children and adults will enjoy . the scenes in which hogarth teaches the giant to do certain things , such as dive into a pool , are handled well , and director brad bird clearly has a sense of comic timing , having worked on \" the simpsons \" for many years . a sequence where hogarth and mansley attempt to \" outlast \" one another by trying to stay awake is very nicely timed , and also extremely clever . the film even takes some jabs at america \\' s nuclear paranoia during the early stages of the cold war , satirizing the lame safety films shown to grade school students that tell them to \" duck and cover \" in the event of a nuclear attack . \" the iron giant \" has much more of a satirical edge to it than most family films , and the edgy humor is actually quite refreshing . instead of seeing people get bonked on the head , we get well - timed , clever gags that seem to have required some imagination to come up with . when you get right down to it , \" the iron giant \" is no more than the story of a boy and his robot . the story is so straightforward , so quaint , that it ultimately becomes charming . though i enjoy the complex plotting of film noir as much as the next person , when it comes to family entertainment , simple is the way to go . it \\' s akin to one of those bedtime stories your father told that had you hanging on his every word , but it \\' s not the story that sets the film above others of its kind , but rather the elements that go into the story , namely real characters and thoughtful dialogue , which \" the iron giant \" has in spades .',\n",

( gee , i wonder ) of course the main draw here is the non - stop \" whiz - bang \" comedy , with a hefty dose of both visual and spoken gags . although i had seen this movie a few times before , i was still laughing thru the entire thing . the most fun character by far is the doctor , played by leslie nielsen . he \\' s a dry , subtle , sterotypically straight - faced doctor that ends up saying some of the funniest lines of the film . in a film like this , you \\' re not really expecting an elaborate production , so one can \\' t complain about the amateurish quality . what you can complain about is the absolutely annoying johnny , played by stephen stucker . this character is pointless , nauseating , and very unfunny . i don \\' t know why he was put in there , and i don \\' t think anybody will find a good excuse . and when the film nears an end , it slows down quite a bit , almost getting old . you gotta give it to a movie that only runs 88 minutes and can feel two hours long . aside from that , airplane ! is really a top - notch spoof that will likely forever be known as a spoof classic . it would be a good choice to pop in the vcr with a group of friends , especially if they haven \\' t seen it . and if they ask what the plot is , just tell \\' em \" it \\' s a synopsis of the basic storyline of the film , but that \\' s not important right now . \" if you \\' ve seen the film , you \\' ll understand ; - )',\n",

( i could go on about how gangsters and criminals of many other ethnicities have gotten thoughtful examinations in the movies -- bound by honor , sugar hill and american me come to mind -- when asians remain perpetually stereotyped . but that \\' s another essay . ) anyway , johnny runs and eventually winds up in newark . why newark ? maybe because it was cheaper to fake a future newark than a future new york , that \\' s why . there , he meets an assortment of odd characters ( ice - t , dolph lundgren and henry rollins play a whole gallery of weirdos ) . the script deals with them with all the depth of pieces of furniture . it turns out ( what else ? ) that the data in johnny \\' s head could save a lot of people , but of course johnny only wants it out of his head so it doesn \\' t kill him . handled right , this could have been absorbing , but the script manages to mangle any chance of real sympathy for johnny at every opportunity . the details about the look and feel of the future are all phoned in from other , better movies -- blade runner and brazil come to mind . everything looks run - down and scummy , everyone dresses like they \\' re punk rockers , and videophones are commonplace . snore . the only really interesting flourish is an extended depiction of the way the internet might work in the future ( complete with vr goggles and feedback gloves ) , but i kept thinking that it was more like what some relatively un - technical fellow would * think * it would look and behave like . a hacker of johnny \\' s caliber would be blasting away with one command - line function after another , instead of wasting all this time twiddling with holograms , but of course that \\' s not cinematic . whatever . what went wrong with this movie ? gibson wrote his own screenplay , which i guess is part of the problem : what works as a short story doesn \\' t work in a movie . his ear for dialogue is terrible and the plot doesn \\' t advance , it convulses . from the script on out , it was probably all downhill . renting the movie to make fun of it is sort of pointless ; there \\' s no fun in kicking a wounded dog , is there ?',\n",

as in the original film , \" toy story 2 \" contains first - rate animation , and pixar studios has done a remarkable job improving on the impressive work they did there . reportedly , the film was originally slated for a direct - to - video release , but after seeing the improvements that had been made , disney rightly decided to release it into theaters . the film is well worth seeing on the big screen . the colors are bright , the textures sharp , and even the human characters look more \" human . \" the animation is consistently seamless , with the action fast and furious and the facial expressions believable . there are so many impressive sequences that i \\' d find it impossible to list them here , but i was particularly wowed by a scene where buzz and his cohorts must get across a busy intersection to get to al \\' s toy barn , the store owned by woody \\' s captor . pixar \\' s rendition of the family dog is also nicely done , with fur so realistic you almost feel you could reach out and touch it . the voice work is also perfectly complementary , and as with the first movie , does much to help further character development . tom hanks and tim allen again disappear into their roles as woody and buzz , making you forget who is doing the voice . it was woody and buzz up there , not tom and tim . all the cast members from the original reprise their roles , and each is excellent . several new voices have been added , with joan cusack , kelsey grammer , and wayne knight doing fine work . \" toy story 2 \" is strong in characterization , and is able to expand on what we saw in the first movie . woody faces difficult choices , while buzz is confronted with a new buzz who hasn \\' t yet realized his status as a toy , forcing him to see what he used to be like . the new characters are also developed quite well , especially jesse , who narrates a sarah mclachlan - aided flashback illustrating how she was loved , then forgotten by her owner . it may be computer - animated , and it may have sappy music , but it \\' s downright touching . the script , despite having a story and screenplay each credited to four different writers , is endlessly clever and inventive , especially considering that it \\' s a sequel . the reason \" toy story 2 \" works where other movie sequels fail is that it refuses to just capitalize on the original \\' s success by re - doing the same story and using the same characters . not this one . we get character change , new characters , and new issues brought up . \" toy story 2 \" is also remarkable for the way in which it keeps reinventing itself . there is always another clever idea waiting just around the corner here . the humor is sharp and witty , with something to amuse both kids and adults . there are funny asides to films such as \" star wars \" and \" jurassic park , \" among others , new takes on classic toys like barbie and rock \\' em sock \\' em robots , and appearances from other pixar efforts \" a bug \\' s life \" and the 1997 short \" geri \\' s game . \" ( geri himself makes an appearance as a toy repairman who fixes woody \\' s broken arm . ) the action is fast and furious , and the chases ( in the street , in a toy store , in an elevator , on a baggage carousel , and in an airplane ) keep getting bigger and better . \" toy story 2 \" never grows stagnant , because there is always something new to hold your interest . the more you pay attention to it , the more rewarding it is . it \\' s rare to see a film like \" toy story 2 \" come along , because it \\' s the kind of film that \\' s almost impossible to dislike . it \\' s created purely to entertain , and though i enjoy a thought - provoking drama as much as the next person , it \\' s nice to see that films are still trying to do exactly what movies first tried to do : send us out with a smile . it \\' s a fair bet that the whole family will have smiles on their collective faces after seeing \" toy story 2 . \" it \\' s the rare sequel that manages to expand on , and live up to , the original .',\n",

( can you picture kieran culkin or jonathan taylor - thomas in the same role ? ) renfro was recently charged with possession of cocaine - i hope he doesn \\' t continue down that path , because he has a big future in good movies waiting for him . as guidance counsellor edward french , \" friend \" schwimmer also deserves mention . he wants to be the parent to todd that todd \\' s own well - to - do folks are not ( todd , like most modern kids - and only - children - has mom and dad wrapped around his pinky finger ) , and his sincerity makes the apt pupil \\' s blackening - heart even more apparent . but one of the film \\' s ultimate questions , are we born evil or do we learn evil ? , might be answered in french , whose motives are the slightest bit ambiguous . no man is an island , indeed - we all have the capacity to make the \" right \" or the \" wrong \" choices . schwimmer winningly plays one of a trio of fascinating characters who make the unconventional apt pupil laudible . - october , 1998 * the excellent collection king \\' s stories called different seasons spawned not only apt pupil , but the shawshank redemption ( originally titled rita hayworth and the shawshank redemption ) and stand by me ( originally titled the body ) .',\n",

              " (\"there must be some unwritten rule that states , one gets enlightenment not in the way one expects to get enlightenment but in the commitment given to seeking wisdom , even if it is a foolish road one is on and it seems to be leading nowhere . in the exotic morocco of 1972 , a 25 - year - old english hippie mother , julia ( winslet ) , of two sweet young girls , the 6 - year - old lucy ( carrie ) and the 8 - year - old bea ( bella ) , has arrived for a year ' s stay , with the self - absorbed mother oblivious to how her daughters might be adjusting to this foreign experience while she is searching for a change of life from her unfaithful poet husband ( she is not officially married to him ) and her cold one - room london flat , and is sort of looking for the eternal truth in the sunny climate of marrakech . at least she says she is , as she is making some attempt to contact a sufi sheikh there who has all the answers . she has not planned things out too carefully , having no money , and the trip doesn ' t seem like it ' s much fun , more like a misadventure , with some romance with a local moroccan thrown in . drugs , a world - wide youthful phenomena during this period , where many westerners came to morocco to smoke the good hashish found there and to live the ' good life ' cheaply , and to be in a spot where they did not have to worry about being hassled by the local authorities , even though drugs are illegal there . but this is not shown as one of her reasons for being here . in this film , the subject of drugs is never broached , only hinted at in an off - handed but slurring way , as the hippie commune is shown in a negative light , strumming on their guitars and bragging about the hits of acid they have taken . even the ones coming here for spiritual reasons , to follow the mystical sufis , seem lost following a culture that is far different from where they were coming from . the film is based on the novel that contained the autobiographical experiences of sigmund freud ' s grand - daughter , esther freud , who traveled here in the 1960s with her mother and sister . it is written by the director ' s brother , who has previously directed regeneration , the playboys , and trojan eddie . the title of the film comes from the squealing giggles that saying hideous kinky gives the little girls . with julia strapped for cash and not receiving a needed check her husband often forgets to send her , she is prevented from seeing the greatest living sufi who is located in algeria ; so instead , she meets an acrobat street performer in the bazaar , bilal ( said taghmaoui ) . he becomes her lover , taking the place of her husband as a father figure for the girls . the girls readily accept him , and there is no big - to - do made about their openly sexual relationship , but the girls really don ' t know what to make of the relationship . it especially bothers bea , who is embarrassed by her mother ' s loose attitude and wants to go home . things go surprisingly sour when bilal takes them to stay in his small village . it seems only that bilal ' s charm is matched by his shiftlessness , as he has a wife who still lives there . this scene didn ' t make too much sense as to why he would take them there knowing the situation , unless the uneducated man was totally uneducated in the customs of his people , also . but i doubt that . the family is now stuck without money in a backward area trying to decide what to do next , as they hitch a ride away from there with a truck driver who nearly kills them when he falls asleep by the wheel . lucy takes it all in stride and has a good disposition for travel , while bea just wants to go to a school and learn something and be a ' normal ' girl . the beauty of marrakech is matched by the terrific performance of kate winslet , as the film accurately encapsulates the timeless city and its bustling street scenes , expansive views , illustrious mosques , and grand sunsets . kate enacts the feel of what it was like to be a westerner , living out the countercultural experiences while awaiting to gather her sensibilities again and was fortunate enough to be able to go home the better off for her experiences , as many a drop - out reluctantly had to do after their stay ran out of money and purpose . the background music from groups like america and jefferson airplane , provided further nostalgia for this easy to look at and easy to grasp film . the only hope was that the two innocent girls would not be permanently harmed while on this sojourn , a venture that should be reserved only for those of college age or older who choose to go there for themselves . the family ' s travel , which is on the edge , has julia waking up screaming from dreams that are bleakly haunting ; but , when she gets up , all there is , is this splendid emptiness all around her and a vacuous life that is starting to bother her . that marrakech is disarmingly gorgeous and that london is old hat to her , is starting to wear thin in her thoughts . it will dawn on her , when bea takes ill , as she reflects on what the sufi guru tells her , whom she finally meets and is driven to tears in his presence . he is the guru who replaced the one she wanted to see but who died before she got a chance to see him . the new guru is grounded in reality , something she is not grounded in , and seems to tell her what she couldn ' t comprehend from anyone else , even comforting her , by telling her that her tears are memories - a gift from god . the film ' s weakness was the empty feeling i got from watching the story unfold in its risk free tenor ( she was there basically to be just escaping from her situation ) and how unappealing the love affair seemed between bilal and julia . the storyline about a helpless single parent , detracted from the vibrant experiences many others of her same baby - boom generation had during their trip to morocco , who were taken in by the mystical culture of sufism , a teaching that has a lot to offer its followers , contrary to the impression the film might give , seemed to pass her by . her knowledge of that trip is only surface deep , at best . she perhaps would have been better off not taking the kids along , smoking some hashish , and have been less assured of herself but to have behaved more like a hippie and she wouldn ' t have been so uptight all the time and had some fun on her journey . after all , the mystical trip is the journey . the film ' s strength is in how all the characters are shown for what they are , and no one is that good or that bad , or judged too harshly for their shortcomings . bilal is unreliable but is capable of generosity . the little girls are precocious but they are lovable . julia , the cornerstone the film is built on , is a mother who cares about the children but doesn ' t know how to take care of them without unintentionally harming them . she was trying to escape from reality and that by returning to london , she has another chance to see if she can find the key to this world or whatever world she is looking for and should no longer have nightmares about where she ' s at . this is a very freudian way to look at things , as this sudden realization , that things are not right puts an an end to her eastern hippie odyssey , at least , for the time being . and , after all is said and done , who ' s to say if the children are also not better off for surviving their experiences , just like she probably was !\",\n",

              " (\"retelling the classic story of joan of arc has been a popular trend this year . earlier this may , leelee sobieski played the passionate title role in the top - rated miniseries that debuted on cbs . and now , director luc besson has delivered his version of the sweeping epic about the teenage girl supposedly sent by god to rescue france from the clutches of their enemies . starring milla jovovich , who is predominantly unconvincing as the heavenly messenger accused of being a witch , ` the messenger : the story of joan of arc ' is a disjointed and overblown historical re - enactment that prevails merely as a bloated mistreatment of the famous legend . besson ( who ' s previous work includes the hyperactive sci - fi ` the fifth element ' ) perhaps entrusted a bit too much faith in ex - wife jovovich , because in ` the messenger ' , the actress is drowning in a pool of her own inexperience . at first , when reports were indicating that jovovich had been chosen for such a demanding role , i was highly doubtful that her marginal talent could carry a film of such a caliber . after seeing the rousing trailer , my hesitant optimism suddenly skyrocketed - milla jovovich looked superb . with the hopeful propulsion of her stellar performance , ` the messenger ' looked like a timeless epic in the making . a timeless epic it is not . besson is hesitant to abandon his unique and flashy style , and the story behind ` the messenger ' is not entirely suited to his demands . on the shoulders of besson ' s choppy and unexciting direction , the film dissipates into an uninspiring hodgepodge of poorly executed battle sequences and bizarre imagery . there is no human exploration into the character of joan ( or jeanne ) . jovovich merely rambles on about the power of god when we have little or no insight into her visionary objective . jovivich ' s unsatisfying portrayal only helps lead to the realization that besson sees jeanne as a piece of spiritual cardboard . she is just another special effect in this continuous visual feast . jovovich does have a few isolated moments of sheer power , but mainly , she looks lost . quite frankly , i don ' t know of any actress who could successfully navigate her way through ` the messenger ' without a major fumble . the script is chock - full of laughable dialogue and unfortunate comedy , as jeanne confronts the uncrowned king charles vii ( john malkovich ) and informs him of her heavenly intentions . faye dunaway plays charles ' overbearing mother - in - law , and dustin hoffman appears over two - hours into the story as a character dubbed ? the conscience ' . all three actors juggle limited screen time , although malkovich is uncharacteristically awful . the battle scenes are extremely bloody , but with the presence of such jittery camera work , they capture none of the excitement or finesse of something like ` braveheart ' . there ' s a particularly graphic and unsettling scene early on , when jeanne ( as a young girl ) watches in horror from a closet as her older sister is murdered and then savagely raped by a bloodthirsty english soldier . even his fellow troopers are petrified . ` the messenger ' is also strictly a 90 ' s update on the classic story . almost too 90 ' s , it seems . there ' s gratuitous use of the f - word and a barrage of slang terms like ` she ' s nuts ! ' sprinkled throughout the screenplay . i was half - expecting jeanne to invite her homeys to come chill in her crib , but it never happened . there ' s also the familiar presence of bizarre besson humor , but none of it comes even remotely close to functioning properly . it seems terribly misplaced , but in a catastrophe as jumbled and disjointed as ` the messenger ' , almost everything does . the musical score by erric serra is spectacular , and the set and production designs are continuously impressive . if it was visual excellence that besson was striving for , then he achieves his goal . but the only time the dramatics come alive in ` the messenger ' is during the closing trial , in which jeanne is found guilty and burned at the stake . during these moments , the historical relevance and dramatic purpose of joan of arc reaches the audience , albeit in a faint stream of light that provokes little power or meaning . it ' s just too delayed for besson to revive his lifeless interpretation , in which he is always concerned with the wrong aspects . ` the messenger : the story of joan of arc ' is an unlikely and unwelcome historical addition to the hollywood shelf . anyone searching for an entertaining epic is going to be painfully slapped with an overblown and confusing film . despite my original hopefulness , milla jovovich is not going to have to worry about thanking the academy .\",\n",

( when lesly calls it the family \\' s \" home \" to mrs . pascal -- they \\' ve never had a visitor before lesly -- mrs . pascal becomes discombobulated until she realizes that lesly is talking about their \" house . \" ) in a film that gives new meaning to the phrase , \" made for each other , \" the twin \\' s biggest , but not their only secret , is that they \\' ve had a long - term incestuous relationship . they don \\' t like to discuss it , although they are not particularly ashamed of it . perfect for viewers who can appreciate perverse comedy , this story never pulls its punches . jackie - o tries in many ways , few subtle , to show that she is a better match for marty than that ditzy fiancee of his . in one scene marty and lesly are playing chop sticks together on the piano when jackie - o pushes her aside and starts playing a challenging classical piece for four hands . marty joins her as his fiancee looks on with envy . the chemistry between parker posey and josh hamilton is nothing short of amazing . they put down their little brother and most of the other sane people in the world . their ripostes are engaging filmmaking at its best . director mark waters keeps the show \\' s energy level high and lets the leads sling zingers at each other at a furious pace . his crisp direction ensures the movie has nary an ounce of fat on it . jackie - o is temperamentally incapable of being nice . and being jealous , she cuts lesly down mercilessly . \" were you poor ? \" jackie - o asks her when she finds that lesly committed the crime of growing up impoverished . \" did you eat pies ? chicken pot pies ? \" \" pancakes actually , lots of pancakes , \" lesly replies with her usual sincerity . \" a donut king , so is she like the queen ? , \" jackie - o cattily inquires of marty when she learns that lesly works at a donut king . \" are we entertaining royalty ? \" with rolfe kent \\' s whimsically sinister music it never seems clear where the story is headed . will it end in a big emotional explosion , a murder , people slowly cutting each other up with words , a familial catharsis , a weather disaster or what ? the emotionally charged play is clearly going somewhere , and the engaging characters captivate the audience with their spell . i \\' ll not say more except that the ending is perfect and a bit of a surprise . the house of yes runs a blazing fast 1 : 25 . it is rated r for sexual situations and conversations , mature themes , violent overtones and some profanity . the movie would be fine for older and mature teenagers , i . e . , treat the movie as it were rated nc - 17 .',\n",

( only in the movies , right ? ) too blitzed to even step foot on a plane , tomas hits the open road with kaisa . loathing each other all the while , they make periodic stops for tomas to puke on the dashboard or pass out -- whenever he isn \\' t muttering what a rotten kid she turned out to be . despite his sloshed viewpoint , tomas recognizes that the apple hasn \\' t fallen very far from the tree . kaisa gets nosebleeds from snorting coke , sabotages her personal relationships through indifference , and is unable to restrain her quick and vindictive temper . ain \\' t they a pair ? unable to find true notes of unspoken familial empathy in the one - note and repetitively bitchy dialogue , screenwriters kristin amundsen and hans petter moland fabricate a series of contrivances to propel events forward -- lost money , roving street hooligans looking for drunks to kick around , nosy cops , and flat tires all figure into the schematic and convenient narrative . by the time they reach the hospital , it \\' s time to unveil the secrets from a dark past that are not only simplistic devices that trivialize the father - daughter conflict , they \\' re also the mainstays of many a bad strindberg wannabe . this revelation exists purely for its own sake . aberdeen doesn \\' t know where else to go . weak , unimaginative casting thwarts the pivotal role of kaisa . if lena headey were a stronger actress , perhaps aberdeen could have been able to coast on the performances and moody , haunting cinematography ( rendering norway into its own pastoral ghost world -- the reference to a certain superior american indie flick intentional ) . headey \\' s too busy acting , using her face and furrowed brow to convey every last twitch of insouciance . if she were paying any attention to skarsg ? rd , maybe she \\' d figure out that doing less can reveal so much more . it \\' s worthwhile to compare aberdeen to an earlier film released in 2001 , jonathan nossiter \\' s captivating signs & wonders . it \\' s not just because skarsg ? rd and rampling played disturbed parental figures in both films ( they \\' re not bound by ceremonial wedlock in aberdeen ) . the differences in the way their characters were presented is significant . in aberdeen , rampling is a luminous diva , preening and static in her hospital bed . despite skarsg ? rd \\' s solid performance as tomas , his pathetic drunk is never given much of a chance to emote anything besides catatonic sorrow . there \\' s genuine ferocity and sexually charged frisson during their understated confrontations in signs & wonders , allowing them to suggest a gray zone of complications that accompany torn romance and years of stifled curiosity . nossiter \\' s film thoroughly explores this neurotic territory in addition to delving into the americanization of greece and the use of mysticism as an illusion to deflect pain . if signs & wonders sometimes feels overloaded with ideas , at least it \\' s willing to stretch beyond what we \\' ve come to expect from traditional drama . aberdeen is never half so ambitious , content to sleepwalk through the rhythms and timing of other movies . when did character driven stories stop paying attention to the complexities of real life ? the depressing answer can be found in lawrence kasdan \\' s trite but occasionally useful grand canyon , where steve martin \\' s hollywood mogul pronounces , \" all of life \\' s riddles are answered in the movies ! \" even foreign films are taking that advice to heart .',\n",

[ theater rating : * * * : good seats , sound , and picture ] war is a topic that can \\' t help but be glorified any way it is portrayed by the media . movies , documentaries , and even history books have a way of making the darker side of humanity exciting since the most general aspects are focused on , such as strategy , politics , and victory . it \\' s easy to forget war , in its most basic form , is a battle of armies out to slaughter each other . forgotten more easily is the fact that each soldier , no matter what his rank or importance , is a real flesh - and - blood person and not just a number . \" saving private ryan \" is one of the few films that dares play up this aspect , especially in its unapologetic , realistic delivery . it proves there \\' s a huge difference between battling and killing . the film opens with one of the most graphic , disturbing scenes in recent memory . it \\' s world war ii , d - day to be exact , and the u . s . military is invading omaha beach where the nazis are more than ready for them . spielberg uses many techniques to create for a total sense of reality . instead of positioned cameras , the footage here seems to have been shot by camera operators running alongside soldiers as if they were just as scared . there is no sense of stability , but of constant , anxious , and confusing motion , giving us the feeling of being in the middle of the battle , and just a vulnerable as the poor troops . \" poor \" is a proper word to describe how pathetic and yet innocent the men fighting are . there is little to no dialogue throughout the loud battle and no prologue to define any characters . we don \\' t get the feeling these are handsome actors playing heroic roles , but that these are men about to kill and be killed for reasons beyond their understanding . the nazis are not portrayed as enemies to be hated , but as people that must be destroyed because they \\' re there . in the movies , the good guys can run through a firestorm of bullets and bombs and not get a scratch , but in reality that wouldn \\' t happen . the men have nothing to shield or protect them besides some metal flanks and dead bodies . they are sitting ducks and we realize this through the perspective of the well - secured germans who can actually see who , what , and where they \\' re shooting , unlike the americans who must fire in a general direction to avoid getting their heads blown off . perhaps the film is flawed by not providing any backstory on the war itself and who the men really are , but that seems to be part of the theme . the film seems to rely on the audience \\' s sense of patriotism , that the american military is \" right \" and good and that the nazis are \" inherently evil . \" the battle scene eventually focuses on a group of men who have miraculously survived and made their way close to the enemy stronghold ( a whole 50 - foot progression ) , and begin to inflict some damage . i have to admit that once the first glimpse of victory over the nazis sprang up , i couldn \\' t help but feel some sense of joy and relief . to triumph against all odds is a cliche to be sure , but there \\' s nothing cliche about the graphic , detailed , atmosphere here because it really happened . one of the most surprising aspects of the film is how little story construction there is , and yet the events that take place make sense and are interesting . the plot is practically irrelevant since the film is more concerned with the reality of the war and the soldiers we meet . tom hanks stars as captain miller , a relatively average man who happens to be the leader of a platoon . he \\' s never obsessive or any such generic , cartoonish characteristic that might dominate a character like this . he doesn \\' t want to be there any more than his men , but when he is given a mission he intends to carry it out . the mission the film is concerned with is , as the title states , saving private ryan . through a series of command started by an ordinary clerical worker , it is brought to a general \\' s attention that three brothers from iowa have been killed in action and their mother will receive notices of each \\' s death simultaneously . when they learn a fourth brother is stationed somewhere in europe , they make it a top priority to have him returned safely to his mother . it \\' s easy to sympathize with this situation , after all , no one should have to lose all their children at once . but finding one man in this war is , as miller puts it , \" like trying to find a needle in a stack of needles . \" the saving of private ryan isn \\' t just a dramatic device , but a thematic one . his salvation represents the sense of innocence the country , the world even , was trying to convince itself it still had . when miller \\' s company hears of the mission , they scoff at the idea assuming he is dead , but miller isn \\' t so quick to shrug it off . he knows the only thing that can really save soldiers from death is hope , and now he has the opportunity to make someone \\' s sense of hope a reality . the mission to find ryan gives miller \\' s group a destination , but not direction . along the way many things happen to them , both good and bad . a few battles are fought , not to be major accomplishments for the war , but because they encounter german soldiers and have no other choice . the act of killing itself becomes one of the film \\' s major philosophical metaphors . the soldiers don \\' t mind killing other soldiers in blind battle , but when they come across a lone survivor who begs them to let him go , they can barely stop themselves from killing him in cold blood as some kind of vengeance for their losses . unfortunately , death is a fact of war , and most films try to avoid it when it comes to the main characters , but here spielberg doesn \\' t want us to think these men are invincible . in fact , only a small amount of color and personality is sketched into each man , and the performances are good enough to make this method work . although the characters are somewhat typical , the actors maintain control over the material at all time . whether they \\' re arguing with each other , telling stories of back home , or fighting the germans , they never go overboard and always seem believable . sure , there \\' s a zinger here and there , but war doesn \\' t change the fact boys will be boys . if and when one dies we too can feel the loss , even though we hardly knew them . the final act brings the story full circle with another tremendous , violent battle sequence . private ryan has been found , but facing four to one odds , can the americans defeat the germans and keep ryan alive ? that \\' s not a premise for thrills , it \\' s symbolic of everything the film has worked for . it would be wrong to say the film has either a happy or sad ending , it ends the way it must end . i remember reading a \" calvin & hobbes \" comic strip where calvin asked his dad something like , \" dad , how do armies of men killing each other solve problems ? \" \" saving private ryan \" is the adult version of that question .',\n",

character is not written with any depth . but jackie \\' s natural charisma shines through , and his comic timing is so perfect , both physically and ( surprise ) verbally that once again he commands the screen whenever he is on . owen wilson , last seen in the embarrassing remake of \" the haunting \" , gives a good natured performance as roy o \\' bannon . his innocence is refreshing and fun . a bad guy that \\' s not really bad . his scenes with jackie are some of the best bits of comic dueling since martin and lewis . lucy liu as princess pei pei is given little to do in the script , but for a change does not play a nymphet or some other deviant . the character is a noble woman of status and wealth , but finds a greater cause as a result of her own imprisonment . the rest of the performances are all broadly drawn comic performances . nothing here is realistic , mind you . \" shanghai noon \" is first and foremost a light , jovial film . and the performances match that style with ease . the cinematography by dan mindel is gorgeous . using calgary , alberta as the prime location . mr . mindel is able to create a lush , romantic western feel to the film . nothing here really looks like nevada , but the locations are so beautifully shot and staged , the film can be looked upon as a loving tribute to earlier films of the genre . and as such , the script by alfred gough and miles millar plays fast and loose with history , but with reverence to past films . homage to such films as \" high noon \" ( obviously ) , \" red river \" and most notably \" butch cassidy & the sundance kid \" all bring a sense of nostalgia to the film . it is a comforting experience . at a time when the western is considered either old hat or irrelevant , here is a film that embraces those old attitudes and ( dare i say ) clich ? s and manages to make them palatable and refreshing . here is a film that is not contemptuous of the genre . this is the purest \" horse opera \" since the days of george o \\' brian or john wayne . director tom dey has crafted a loving tribute to hollywood \\' s past . in this , his first film mr . dey shows both a love of character and of craftsmanship that is refreshing to see . nothing here really stands out , or takes one \\' s attention away from the story or action . and that is as it should be , when jackie chan is your star . and what of the action and stunts . well , while not up to a level of \" drunken master 2 \" or any of jackie \\' s hong kong films , \" shanghai noon \" is miles ahead of anything jackie has done in an american film before . his timing , choreography , and creativity are still as sharp as ever . jackie even gets to recreate a few scenes from his earlier films ( obvious to those of us that have seen those films , but refreshingly fun for those unfamiliar ) . finally jackie can honestly say , that he has made an u . s . , his way and incorporating his style . to sum up , \" shanghai noon \" is a fun summer confection . not too heavy and not too light . a fun and entertaining film that the whole family can enjoy ( parents be advised there are scenes of smoking , drunkenness and peyote use ) . an enjoyable and charming film that can and will be enjoyed again and again .',\n",

' nuff said . _soldier_ is proof that hollywood still has plenty of bad ideas sitting in its script vaults . that this sad film made it to the silver screen should encourage plenty of aspiring screenwriters out there that there is hope after all . now if you ' ll excuse me , i have to go weep for the future .\",\n",

              " ('the film \" magnolia \" can be compared to a simple flower as its title and movie poster suggests . the dozens of characters introduced and developed are like the petals on the flower . they all come from the same stem and as the flower begins to develop they grow farther and farther apart . the numerous characters in the film are all closely connected no matter how different they are from one another socially . from a humiliated but kind cop to an aging game show host , each one of these characters is suffering the same kind of pain . they are each seriously lonely and seek the perfect companion to end this loneliness . whether this companion is a distant family member or a spouse , each character begs for one and spends the whole film searching for the perfect one . \" magnolia \" is a clever , well thought out film from prodigy director - writer paul thomas anderson of \" boogie nights \" fame . the detailed character analyses and the powerful script make \" magnolia \" memorable . however , what really is impressive is that even though there are tons of characters in several unrelated stories , the film is never confusing . anderson \\' s control over transitioning from one story to another story is masterful . he also knows exactly when to cut to another subplot since not one of \" magnolia \\' s \" scenes drag on too long . any three hour film that does not deliver even one uninteresting scene is definitely worth recommending . from the fascinating beginning to the risky yet surprisingly satisfying ending the film just doesn \\' t get boring . it is obvious that anderson put a lot of time into connecting each subplot . this is the ultimate game of six degrees of separation . every character is connected to every other character by at the most two degrees . for example , cop john c . reilly is connected to game show host phillip baker hall through hall \\' s daughter melora walters who once went on a date with reilly . the fact that each character is so different from the others yet so similar shows that there are universal pains that all classes , races , and genders suffer . anderson \\' s explanation to prove this point is both accurate and convincing . the only mistake anderson made in trying to connect his characters was by making his actors all sing an aimee mann song simultaneously . this was foolish not only because it was unbelievable and hilariously erroneous but also because it had a broadway musical feel to it and this movie is about as far apart from your typical broadway musical than you can get . the performances in \" magnolia \" are perfection . this is a classic example of flawless casting and flawless ensemble acting . anderson allows many of hollywood \\' s best supporting actors to blossom at what they do best , character acting . all of the main characters in each story are perfect because they are able to reveal more emotions and attitudes in their brief time on the screen then most movie stars can do in a feature length film . worth noting is tom cruise , who stepped out of his usual superficial starring role and into a funny but depressing tour de force performance . he was probably noticed more than the other actors in the film by award givers because his role here is so much different and impressive than those in the past ( however any actor in this film could be nominated for best supporting actor without any complaints ) the only problem i had with the acting was that a few of the characters felt seriously edited down such as melinda dillon \\' s character as phillip baker hall \\' s wife . she seemed to be thrown in towards the end and i felt very little sympathy for her because i had not seen her enough earlier in the film . \" magnolia \" uses several effective metaphors to describe its characters . anderson has the talent to make the audience sympathetic towards numerous people in only a few hours . to see that anderson is able to perfectly portray this many different types of people shows that he has a keen sense of diversity . diversity is what makes a director successful for a long period of time . i predict a lot of diversity and success from anderson in the future .',\n",

\" ) . the day wide - eyed , shy new student cameron james ( joseph gordon - levitt ) starts school at seattle - based padua high , he is swept away at the sight of the beautiful and popular sophomore , bianca stratford ( larisa oleynik ) . although he doesn \\' t know french , he purposefully learns some of it just so he can tutor her , but finds that her paranoid gynecologist father ( larry miller ) won \\' t allow her to date until her bitter , unconventional older sister , kat ( julia stiles ) , a senior , decides to . kat , of course , has sworn off the likes of boys , but cameron sets out to find someone that will be the perfect match for her , which is exactly what he finds in the form of the rebellious patrick verona ( heath ledger ) . complicating matters , cameron \\' s dorky friend , michael ( david krumholtz ) , decides to use a wealthy jock , joey ( andrew keegan ) , who also has his sights set on bianca , as a pawn so that he will pay patrick to get kat to go out with him , and then cameron hopes to steal bianca away from joey . as you can see , \" 10 things i hate about you \" includes a huge number of characters , some of which i haven \\' t even mentioned , such as kat \\' s shakespeare - obsessed friend , mandella ( susan may pratt ) and bianca \\' s materialistic comrade , chastity ( gabrielle union ) . at a short , but well - used running time of 98 minutes , all of the characters are perfectly handled , satisfyingly developed , and , for the most part , are not treated as caricatures ( another flaw of \" she \\' s all that , \" where the bad guys ( and gals ) ran around constantly saying , \" you \\' re vapor \" ) . since i could sympathize with the realistic depictions of the central characters , and since many of the comedic and dramatic scenes were surprisingly effective , i got completely caught up in all of the relationships and was thoroughly entertained . aside from a good screenplay , it \\' s the performances that can make or break a movie , and director junger has really hit the jackpot . aside from joseph gordon - levitt ( \" 3rd rock from the sun \" ) , who gives his strongest performance to date here , none of the actors are that well - known , but it is this aspect that brings a particular freshness to the proceedings . as the main character of kat , julia stiles ( last seen in the miniseries \" the \\' 60s \" ) is marvelous and always believable , and certainly has a bright future ahead of her . even though it is her role that is initially the most difficult and hard - edged , it was easy to identify with kat \\' s way of thinking ( she is against the silly tradition of the prom and loves reading sylvia plath ) , and i completely admired her individuality . no one , i think , could have portrayed her as perfectly as stiles does . heath ledger , as the infamous bad - boy of the town , injects much life into patrick , and has a lot of chemistry with stiles . one other actor of note is larisa oleynik who , with the help of screenwriters lutz and smith , is able to turn bianca into a person with multi - dimensions , even though she is accurately self - centered at the on - set . in one truthful scene , cameron angrily asks her if she has always been so selfish , and bianca grudgingly realizes that yes , she has . one off - beat element of the film , and a source of some hearty laughs , is the way that the school \\' s staff act , which is strikingly unformal . allison janney , as the guidance counselor ms . perky , who is writing a trashy harlequin romance novel , is comic dynamite , as is daryl \" chill \" mitchell as the english teacher , who reads shakespeare to the class in rap and , at one point , sends kat to the office because , for once , she actually thinks one of his assignments is really good . although there are a few cheap laughs that are thrown into the film near the beginning , most of it actually works , especially in the humorous and witty dialogue exchanges and quirks between the characters . in one very funny scene , chastity asks , \" i know people can be overwhelmed , and they can be underwhelmed , but can people just be . . . whelmed ? \" at another point , bianca and kat \\' s father ( a stand - out larry miller ) , who is constantly terrified that his daughters are going to get pregnant , only allows bianca to go to the prom on one occasion : before she leaves , she has to put on the heavy fat suit he has so she will get an idea of what it \\' s like to be pregnant . \" 10 things i hate about you \" once and for all proves that there is still life in the teen comedy genre , and this movie is probably more reminiscent of the great john hughes than any other film of the \\' 90s . it also helps that the movie has a perfectly - assembled soundtrack , mixing indie - rock with new wave \\' 80s songs ( and with , thank goodness , no rap ) . by the film \\' s end , it actually had me rooting for certain characters to get together , and i was also quite pleased with how everything was wrapped up , especially in the final scenes involving kat and bianca , kat and her father , and a flawlessly - acted and moving sequence in which kat gets up to read the poem she has written for her english class ( this is where the title comes from ) . luckily , i doubt i would be able to find ten things i hate about \" 10 things i hate about you , \" but the positive aspects of the film far out - number ten .',\n",

              " (\"the plot of big momma ' s house is martin lawrence in a fat suit and a dress . that ' s not just the high - concept premise ; it ' s the fully - realized , all - encompassing plot . such an emphasis is not unheard - of in the world of hollywood summer entertainment . one need merely look back to last summer , when the plot of big daddy was adam sandler being an incompetent surrogate parent . the trap inherent in such an approach is that the high - concept plot idea better be pretty well - realized , or rest on the shoulders of an extremely talented performer , because you can bet there will be nothing else worth a second of your time -- not a developed character , not a provocative theme , not a witty twist . you will get 90 - plus minutes of martin lawrence in a fat suit and a dress -- nothing more , nothing less . those who find martin lawrence more than an occasionally amusing screen presence may have a shot at enjoying the one - note dud that is big momma ' s house . others will simply stare , mouth agape , at its sheer unapologetic laziness . lawrence plays fbi agent malcolm turner , an undercover expert on a stakeout assignment with his partner john ( paul giamatti ) . dangerous convicted bank robber and murderer lester vesco ( terrence howard ) has escaped from prison , and the feds think he ' s headed for his former girlfriend and presumed - but - never - proved accomplice sherry ( nia long ) . sherry , however , has fled with her son trent ( jascha washington ) , possibly to visit her grandmother hattie mae ( ella mitchell ) , better known as big momma . indeed , sherry appears to be on her way , but big momma is headed out of town without knowing sherry is coming . that leaves master of disguise malcolm to go under very heavy cover as big momma and find out what sherry knows . big momma ' s house ' s bloodlines are certainly traceable to mrs . doubtfire -- director raja gosnell edited that film , and the makeup effects were similarly created by greg cannom -- but there ' s just as strong a whiff of tootsie in the main character ' s attempt to use his alternate identity to get closer to a woman . unfortunately , big momma ' s house makes a ridiculous decision neither of those other films made : instead of having the protagonist pose as a completely manufactured character unfamiliar to anyone elses , it places malcolm in the position of playing a friend and family member to several other characters . suspension of disbelief in big momma ' s house requires you to believe every other person in the film is blind and / or stupid , since no one notices that one big momma looks or sounds absolutely nothing like the other . of course , laughs trumps logic every time , and big momma ' s house probably still would have worked in spite of its utter disdain for common sense if it had just managed to be funny . and it misses its best possible opportunity for some great farce by ignoring the simple fact that the real big momma is set up as a foul - tempered beast , while malcolm has to be nurturing in order to get the information he wants out of sherry . unfortunately , no one involved appears to have the faintest idea how to deal with the comic gold mine involved in one real person pretending to be another , very different real person , so they fall back on an endless parade of sight gags : malcolm reacting violently to big momma ' s explosive diarrhea attack ; malcolm - as - momma schooling a pair of cocky teens in basketball ; malcolm trying to avoid detection as various prostheses give way at inopportune moments ; malcolm delivering a baby because big momma is the town midwife ( one of the few sequences that works ) . martin lawrence can be likeable enough at times , but there ' s no reason to care a whit about his budding romance with sherry because malcolm is never an independently significant character . he ' s just big momma without the makeup on . i won ' t waste time commenting on how ineptly the set - up of the escaped convict is employed , since it was clearly a waste of time to the film - makers . there are a few token scenes of lester looming as a threatening figure , but he ' s ultimately a distraction in a film that ' s really about its central visual incongruity ( and the accompanying lascivious glances at nia long ' s posterior ) . i ' m never prepared to underestimate how appealing that idea may be to other people -- several million of them apparently found adam sandler as an incompetent surrogate parent appealing -- but i know that when a film - maker tries to throw a concept at me and pretend that it ' s an entire film , i duck out of the way . the gross implausibility of big momma ' s house might have been tolerable if it was seasoned with more big , cleverly - constructed laughs . its lack of big laughs might have been tolerable if its characters were at all relevant . big momma ' s house is ridiculous _and_ not funny . it ' s just a sad exercise in the jaded presumption that any scene should be considered wacky and hilarious if it involves martin lawrence in a fat suit and a dress .\",\n",

this seems enough to illustrate my point . this movie is really stupid . it never even gives the audience a chance to suspend their disbelief . also , the obvious comparison between the appearance of cro - magnon man in prehistory and the rise of feminism in our century is about as subtle as burning a wonderbra in front of charlton heston . the movie doesn \\' t just suggest this message ; it whacks the message into the audience with a two - by - four . a blond , gorgeous woman challenges the social laws of a bunch of people in gaudy brown wigs . she \\' s of the \" new people \" ; they \\' re of the \" old people \" with \" the memories . \" yep . we get it . we get it . the clan of the cave bear apparently received an academy award nomination for best make - up , which surprises me . the movie depends upon a lot of make - up obviously , but much of it is unconvincing . as stated before , daryl hannah is daryl hannah here ; she looks like she just stepped out of the shower all the time . the rest of the characters have dark make - up of some sort smeared over them to look like dirt . the face - painting that \\' s occasionally seen is perhaps the only notable work here in my mind . this movie also suffers from its new age trappings . maybe the music sounded a lot more fresh or original during 1985 , but now it sounds dated and cliched , like poorly conceived elevator music . add to this the film \\' s faux - mysticism , including spirit animals and dream visions , and a narrator who sounds like a psychic you \\' d expect to hear on a 1 - 900 number , and you get a movie that has serious problems being serious . the clan of the cave bear is rated r , though it \\' s probably one of the most inoffensive offensive films i \\' ve seen in quite a while . it contains several scenes of sex sans nudity . the violence mostly consists of hunting scenes . the funniest moment of the movie occurs when a neanderthal in love with ayla attempts to rescue her from a ferocious bear . the bear bites his head off and the audience sees it rolling about . although this may sound gratuitous , i \\' m sure , it \\' s so cheesy that it probably won \\' t bother most people . the clan of the cave bear is a bad movie . however , as i wrote at the beginning of this review , it does have the distinction of originality . typically when i think of bottom - of - the - barrel films dealing with early man , fantasy movies involving dinosaurs ( who did not exist at the same time as man ) and raquel welch come to mind . the clan of the cave bear tries so hard to be serious that , though it \\' s so bad , the audience is still interested by the unique setting and characters of the movie ( which is why i awarded this turkey two stars ) . i have to think that fans of the book would be disappointed with this film version ; however , i \\' m only basing this observation on the fact that the book is almost invariably better than the movie . i shudder to think that it could be otherwise . . .',\n",

              " ('over 40 years ago , a japanese production company called toho introduced the land of the rising sun to gojira , a reptilian creature of immense proportions created by mankind \\' s nuclear testing . partly flight of fancy , partly commentary on the exploitation of atomic power and weaponry , gojira emerged from the ocean to terrorize tokyo . a year later , gojira was marketed to the united states by adding three things : a new name , a dubbed english track , and raymond burr . as godzilla , the film took on the rest of the world . thirty years later , toho remade the classic film and once again took it to the american market by adding the same three things ( yes , including raymond burr ) and called it godzilla 1985 . now it \\' s 14 years after toho \\' s remake , and director roland emmerich has allowed the giant lizard to make an american first run . in emmerich \\' s godzilla , matthew broderick plays dr . niko tatopoulos , a biologist who is called in to join other scientists in the south pacific already studying the existence of a radiation - induced super mutant which leaves footprints the size of livingrooms . when the mutant reptile suddenly appears out of the hudson river , tatopoulos and the rest of the team relocate themselves back to the states . meanwhile , tatopoulos \\' s college girlfriend , audrey timmonds ( maria pitillo ) , works in new york city as an assistant to a big - time news reporter . she \\' d like to be a reporter herself , and when godzilla comes ashore , she figures this is her big break . of course , with the big guy running amok in the city , niko and audrey are bound to cross paths , and are joined by victor \" animal \" palotti ( hank azaria ) , audrey \\' s trusty cameraman friend , and phillipe roche ( jean reno ) , an operative for the french government , whose nuclear testing started the whole problem in the first place . together they attempt to find and destroy the surprisingly elusive godzilla . with the resources of the most cutting edge special effects houses and the clout of one of the nation \\' s premiere movie production companies , one would think emmerich could make a film truly deserving of the name godzilla . he didn \\' t . right up there with the lost world , godzilla is one of the biggest disappointments in recent cinematic history . the plot is pretty much what we expect : the big dinosaur - like creature comes out of the water and starts smashing new york city , and it \\' s up to our heroes to figure out why this thing is on its rampage and how it can be stopped , while the military makes futile attempts to bring the creature down . the script , however , is painfully bad . it \\' s fraught with lines so corny , they don \\' t even belong in b - movies , and includes many character actions which make you think , \" you idiot , \" or \" you stupid girl . \" i suppose when you \\' ve got a movie with a giant lizard loose in new york , any other semblance of reality goes out the window as well . why is it that godzilla topples some buildings by merely brushing against them , but is conveniently able to leap atop others ? why do helicopters have to follow godzilla by flying dangerously between buildings where they can lose sight of him , when they could more easily keep track of him by flying a little higher and in a straight line ? why do sidewinder missiles , which have small explosive warheads , blow up entire buildings when they miss godzilla ? why is a mission to bomb madison square garden carried out by three f - 18 fighter - bombers , when flights of such aircraft are always comprised of multiples of two ? okay , maybe the last one was a bit nit - picky , but hey , i was on a roll . broderick is usually a good actor , but in this film he \\' s weighed down by an unexciting character and an atrocious screenplay which seem to fight against him every step of the way . hank azaria does what he can , but don \\' t expect to see development of any of the promise he showed in the birdcage . like broderick \\' s , azaria \\' s character is quite simply lacking in color . what really annoyed me was maria pitillo , who actually takes the bad script and makes it worse with her acting . casting must have been asleep on this one . the one bright spot here is jean reno , who oddly enough seems to fit well into a role which is often comedic , quite unlike what we \\' ve seem him do in the past . although his character is contradictory to the unfolding disaster , reno brings a style to the role of phillipe which makes him enjoyable . unfortunately , the same cannot be said of the other incongruities . the entire feel of the movie is tongue - in - cheek , and seems to pay comical homage to a dozen or so films that have come before it . this results in a significant amount of parody , which contrasts sharply with the threat of the monster , and ends up just producing a mess . most of the characters seem to be there for comic relief , and almost none are smart enough for the audience to take seriously . although emmerich obviously wanted to make a fun action picture , what good is it to sink millions into a cgi creature whose ferocity is undermined by the humans he threatens ? if we can \\' t take the characters seriously , the threat they face is an empty one because we simply don \\' t care what happens to them . godzilla simply pulls too many punches in its attempt to be a film more light - hearted than it should be . far be it from me to want to see more carnage in the theaters , but here \\' s a behemoth running through the city ! there \\' s bound to be a lot of casualties , but instead godzilla is afflicted with the after - school g . i . joe cartoon syndrome , where almost everyone seems to get out of harm \\' s way just in time . in a couple of scenes , godzilla briefly breathes fire . none of the characters even remark upon this ability , nor is it used to any particular advantage by the filmmakers . it \\' s as if the special effects people just wanted to show that yes , godzilla can do this , just like in the old movie . consider another punch pulled . through creative script writing , you can make a sequel out of just about any movie , but the final scene in this one doesn \\' t just leave the door open , it opens into a hallway leading directly into a room where godzilla ii is waiting patiently . it made me want to gag . emmerich should have done away with 90 % of the humor and in - jokes and played this one as a straight action film . with an intelligently written screenplay , godzilla could have been so much more . however , by confusing the viewer with a ton of add - ins and parodies , the movie ends up being something that just doesn \\' t work . now if they only had raymond burr . . . .',\n",

              " ('with more and more television shows having gay characters , and even the infamous \" ellen \" sitcom being centered on the life of a lesbian , the movie industry too seems to be gaining more and more homosexual based plot lines . the birdcage was critically acclaimed , as was this years chasing amy . then along came in & out , and all three of these films are on my top ten list for the years in which they were released . it \\' s also noticeable that this \" alternative lifestyle \" becomes less and less taboo as the years go by , and it seems that using comedy as a medium is proving a worthwhile effort . while it \\' s a very serious issue to many , it is the comedies that people are flocking to see and that are gaining notoriety . but the way we \\' re using comedy to present homosexuality is also changing quite dramatically . while the gay community was once very stereotyped and used to laugh * at * , it is more and more becoming something we laugh * with * , and when a movie like in & out comes along , it is something that both heterosexuals and homosexuals should be able to thoroughly enjoy . it doesn \\' t poke fun at the lifestyle , it simply uses it to all it \\' s comedic capacity , just as love , sex , marriage , birth , death , and anything else has been . the idea for in & out was born the day tom hanks won his oscar for portraying an aids - afflicted gay man in philadelphia . if you remember , during his acceptance speech , hanks gave a highly emotional tribute to the gay community , and even sighted a former gay teacher of his as a major inspiration in his life . it \\' s a serious and touchy subject , but producer scott rudin viewed it as the setting for a potentially hilarious comedy , and pitched it to screenwriter paul rudnick . it \\' s true that if this same film had been written by a heterosexual , it may have been more controversial , but because it was written by an openly gay writer , the prerogative was set . kevin kline , who only seems to become more and more acclaimed , stars as howard brackett , a high school english teacher in the small , picturesque town of greenleaf , indiana . after a three - year engagement to fellow teacher emily montgomery ( joan cusack ) , a wedding date has been set , and the hubbub surrounding it is almost as big as that surrounding another huge story - greenleaf high graduate cameron drake ( matt dillon ) is up for a best actor oscar . the small town eagerly awaits both events , and both seem quite astronomical , but little does anyone know how much one will affect the other . when cameron drake is announced the winner , the excitement is heightened as he pays tribute to his high school english teacher , mr . brackett . everyone is cheering back in greenleaf - that is until cameron tacks on those three calamitous words , \" and he \\' s gay . \" the town becomes silent as the entire population joins in a simultaneous jaw drop . the thing is , nobody , including howard , can understand how cameron came to that conclusion , and such wild and unexpected news can only wreak havoc in such a conservative american haven such as greenleaf . naturally the questions pour from howard \\' s fiancee , parents ( debbie reynolds & wilford brimley ) , students , and the high school \\' s principal , tom halliwell ( bob newhart ) , and the evidence starts to become more and more obvious : howard is clean , neat , honest , sincere , a romantic , and perhaps the most incriminating fact , he loves barbara streisand . the frenzy isn \\' t helped any when camera crews from every conceivable news magazine and \" entertainment tonight \" wannabe show up at greenleaf high the very next morning . one particular reporter is peter malloy ( tom selleck ) of \" inside entertainment \" , who unlike the collage of other reporters , wants to spend a whole week in the life of howard brackett , including coverage of his wedding . the intrusion is all but welcome by howard , who is going more and more out of his mind with each passing minute . it seems that no matter where he turns , a camera is being shoved in his face and questions regarding homosexuality are being tossed to him like frisbees . the dominoes begin to tumble as howard \\' s closest friends begin acting different and principal halliwell hints at a possible termination of employment should howard indeed be gay . it all sounds very devastating , and it would be if it weren \\' t presented with near - perfection by one of this year \\' s most delightful ensemble casts . kline seems only to improve with age , and he is downright perfect here . the great thing about this film is that every single character has a moment to shine , and they use it wonderfully . every single actor turns in one of their best performances ever . dillon has never been so likeable , cusack has never seemed so perfect for a role , and brimley , reynolds , and newhart all provide huge laughs when they \\' re up to bat . rudnick \\' s script is heavily laced with wit and humor , and you \\' ll likely find yourself laughing out loud for a solid ninety minutes . while in & out doesn \\' t carry enough to give it four stars , it remains one of the best done films of the year , all - around . the script is exuberant , the actors are absolutely top - notch , and we \\' re allowed just the perfect blend of heart - tugging so as not to bog down the laughs . it remains a solid comedy throughout its entirety , yet we \\' re still allowed a sappily touching ending . despite it \\' s subject matter , and one scene that comes almost too close for comfort on explaining gay sex , this is a movie that everyone could , and should , enjoy . frank oz , best known as a voice talent for muppets , directs this film quite delightfully , using all the potential rudnick \\' s script has to offer , which turns out to be quite a bit . check this one out . you \\' ll have a gay old time .',\n",

              " (\"the laserman : somehow the title of writer - director - producer peter wang ' s film conjures up images of superheroes , like ultraman and spiderman . you kind of expect an adventure flick about a crime fighter who can shoot laser beams from his fingertips . as it turns out , the laserman _is_ about crime and about laser beams , but there aren ' t any superheroes . instead , wang ' s film is populated by a group of refreshingly off - beat characters living in the ultimate cultural melting pot : new york city . the laserman is a comic brew which celebrates ethnicity , eccentricity , and electricity . the film tells the bizarre story of arthur weiss ( marc hayashi ) , a chinese - american laser scientist whose life becomes incredibly hectic after he accidentally kills his lab assistant in an experiment . he loses his job but finds work with a mysterious company which secretly plans to use laser technology to commit dastardly deeds . arthur ' s professional life is cluttered with moral dilemmas . his personal life , on the other hand , is cluttered with colorful friends and quirky relatives . in fact , arthur is by far the blandest character in the film , despite a charismatic performance by hayashi ( the san francisco - based actor whose films include chan is missing and the karate kid ii ) . it ' s the auxiliary characters who give the laserman its unique spark . arthur ' s not - so - typical jewish mother , ruth , for example , is convinced that a chinese soul is trapped in her jewish body . she has dyed her red hair black , she takes herbal medicine daily , and she is perpetually cooking up strange delicacies , such as matzo balls in soy sauce -- the ultimate fusion of jewish and chinese cuisine . veteran stage actress joan copeland takes the part and runs with it , almost stealing the movie in the process . she plays ruth as a driven woman , determined to overcome her genetic heritage by immersing herself in chinese culture . arthur ' s girlfriend janet ( maryann urbano ) is a kooky free - spirit who would rather meditate than copulate ; her ultimate goal is orgasm through zen meditation . arthur ' s best friend , joey ( tony leung ) , is a small time thief who hustles everything from microwave ovens to machine guns . joey is married to arthur ' s jewish sister , but he is also having an affair with a chinese immigrant who works in a whore house . arthur ' s 11 - year - old son , jimmy , played by the amazingly adorable david chan , is -- horror of horrors -- bad at math ! he finds it impossible to meet his father ' s lofty expectations . the various people in arthur ' s life come together to form a rich tapestry of humanity . like wang ' s earlier film , a great wall ( about a san francisco family visiting relatives in china ) , the laserman revolves around cultural differences . every character in the film is , in some way or another , trying to find his identity -- struggling to negotiate a balance between his native culture and the american way . the movie also offers a provocative look at technology . wang appears in the movie as lieutenant lu , a detective who is fed up with machines , even though he relies on them to do his job . the film views technology with a wary eye , acknowledging its necessity while at the same time realizing its potential dangers . wang raises the time - honored question of whether scientists should be held responsible for their inventions . was einstein responsible for the a - bomb ? is arthur weiss responsible for his lasers ? the movie pits spirituality against technology , man against machine , and the result is a draw . according to the film , technology has its place , but we must employ it with great forethought and caution . ironically , by its very nature , the laserman is a triumph of technology -- the technology of filmmaking . wang ' s direction is exquisite , especially during the tense finale in which the director frantically cross - cuts between the various subplots , perhaps in homage to d . w . griffith . cinematographer ernest dickerson , who has worked on all of spike lee ' s films , gives the laserman a distinctive , artistic look . mason daring ' s score , which includes a send - up of bach , is right on target . the laserman is an ambitious endeavor , which is to be applauded , but it ' s sometimes ambitious to a fault . wang serves up so many slices of life in the film that it ' s hard to digest them all . for instance , one character ( arthur ' s sister ) has negligible screen time , and consequently we just don ' t care about her marital problems . in weaving his web , wang has included a few too many strands . overall , however , the laserman is a charmingly eclectic concoction . on the surface , the film is a light and bouncy comedy - thriller , overflowing with whimsical humor and visual style . the heavier issues emerge only when you take a deeper look at the film . you can ponder the moral questions or you can just sit back and enjoy the absurdity of life in china town .\",\n",

( of course , in horror films the foreshadowing and between - the - line moments are meant to be overdone , so perhaps he too is just learning to play the game . ) even with all its flaws , music of the heart is a beautiful film . that is not an excuse for the movie \\' s poor beginning . but as i watched the scenes in carnegie hall , i thought of some of the great acts that have taken that stage . in december of 1979 a comedian named andy kaufman put on a show that will forever be remembered as one of the most original in theatre history . the performance included a dead - on elvis impression , robin williams in disguise and a moment at the end when kaufman announced he would take the whole audience out for milk and cookies . so , how did this comic genius choose to open the show of his life ? he had a character named tony clifton take the stage for the sole purpose of irritating and angering the audience . perhaps it is okay for music of the heart to start off rusty because just as kaufman had santa \\' s favorite food , this movie has an amazing finale .',\n",

              " ('back in february at the monthly los angeles comic book and science fiction convention , new line cinema put on a lavish presentation for its big - screen update of the cult 1960s sci - fi tv show lost in space , complete with in - person appearances by cast members mimi rogers , matt leblanc , lacey chabert , jack johnson , and even gary oldman . that should have set off my warning alarms -- the last time such an extravagant film presentation took place at the convention was nearly five years ago , when none other than arnold schwarzenegger made an in - person cameo to peddle . . . last action hero . but no , like millions of others , i bought into the hype and \" got lost . \" if only i had gotten lost -- literally -- on the way to theatre and spared myself the tedium of this sloppily slapped - together blockbuster wannabe . you may find yourself wondering if director stephen hopkins and screenwriter akiva goldsman were lost themselves when they made the film . at the convention , goldsman claimed to be a rabid fan of the original television series , and if that really is the case , i \\' d hate to see what he does with concepts he only has mild interest in . to say that his script lacks narrative cohesion is to imply that there is a narrative to begin with -- which there most certainly is not . after the setup , in which the robinson family -- father john ( william hurt , looking and sounding as spaced out as he does in interviews ) , mother maureen ( rogers , wasted ) , daughters judy ( heather graham , ditto ) and penny ( a heavily made - up chabert , looking like a junior version of neve campbell in wild things ) , and son will ( young newcomer johnson , making the best of it ) -- and pilot don west ( leblanc , doing a bad han solo impression ) find themselves lost in space after their ship is sabotaged by evil stowaway dr . smith ( a watered - down but still - lively oldman , cashing a paycheck and loving every minute ) , the script \\' s \" stream \" of events becomes so fragmented and random that it seems to be made up as it goes along -- and hopkins does little to make what does go on the slightest bit interesting . they encounter another ship . they board it . alien spiders attack them . they return to their ship . the other one explodes . they land on a deserted planet . and so on . an attempt at a plot involving time travel occurs in the third act , but goldsman doesn \\' t seem to understand the rules that come with using such a story device ; when one character \\' s past self dies , the future incarnation inexplicably lives on . the look and effects should be lost in space \\' s ace - in - the - hole , but hopkins even manages to botch that . for a big - budget film , the visual effects are incredibly shoddy . in one composite background shot , i could see the blue outline around oldman ; the various digital effects for the space battle scenes look like . . . digital effects . but nothing in those shots is as jaw - droppingly unconvincing as blawp , a monkey - like space creature that becomes penny \\' s pet . entirely computer - generated and every inch showing it , blawp looks like it was lifted directly from a sony playstation game . apparently hopkins thought the same and tried desperately to hide it ; how else can one explain the graininess of blawp \\' s composite shots with the human actors ? but in doing so , the seams are that much more obvious . you have to be severely visually impaired to not be distracted when a grainy shot of penny and blawp is immediately followed by a crystal - clear solo reaction shot of judy . new line is hoping lost in space will become a big franchise much like the long - running star trek cash cow at paramount . i don \\' t think so . in a few years , the lost in space movie will likely live on not as a series but as the obscure answer to a trivia question : what film ended titanic \\' s 15 - week reign at the top of the weekend box office ?',\n",

              " ('i read the new yorker magazine and i enjoy some of their really in - depth articles about some incident . they will take some incident like the investigation of a mysterious plane crash and tell you what happened in detail . it becomes a real education in what agencies get involved and how theories are suggested , and what kind of pressure the investigators are under , and just about any other aspect you can think of . frequently i get the feeling that the article sounded exciting , but i am being told in more detail than i really wanted to know . often i get to the middle of a story and say , ok , it sounded good but i now have invested more time than i am willing to spend on this subject . film is a different medium . it is a visual medium . that slows down the telling of stories much more than people realize . i frequently am surprised to find out how short a film script is and how much of the pages are empty space . the magazine article and the film script are two very different media . the insider is a film adaptation of the vanity fair article \" the man who knew too much \" by marie brenner . it is too much an adaptation of a magazine article slowed to the pace of a film . it really verges on being tedious at least at times . for years the seven big companies knew that they dealt in an addictive drug that caused a host of unhealthy side - effects . but they pretended for the public that it was unproven and they did not really believe it . the business was incredibly profitable and the proceeds translated into the political power to squelch and discredit any political movements against big tobacco . the tide turned when a former vice - president of one of the companies was convinced by the cbs 60 minutes news team to tell the public how much the tobacco companies really knew about the health effects of smoking . the resulting pressure to stop the story created a small civil war at cbs . who were the major people involved , what were their motives , how was the story almost killed , how did it get aired anyway ? that is the story covered in surprising detail by the insider . this all could have been enthralling , but it is not the sort of thing that a stylist like michael mann would be likely to do well . and in the end , he failed . to make a long story short , the film needed a director who knew how to make a long story short . the film opens with the cbs 60 minutes team in iran with the assignment to interview a terrorist . we get a taste for their personal style and how they get the upper hand . they go from being one newsman blindfolded at the hands of the terrorists to the actual interview with mike wallace ( played by christopher plummer ) . there the news team under producer lowell bergman ( al pacino ) are ordering around the terrorists and getting away with it . this seems to have nothing to do with the main line of the story , but later when the tobacco industry is so much harder to manipulate than committed terrorists , we have a wry irony on who really has clout in the world . terrorists can grab the headlines , but the tobacco companies have the real position of power . incongruously intercut with the iran interview sequence we see jeffrey wigand ( russell crowe ) dejectedly returning from work to his home . we discover that he has been fired and his career brought to a complete halt unexpectedly . he had been a very profitably rewarded vice - president in charge or research and development at brown and williams tobacco ; now he was unemployed and needed money to support his family . rather than support him his wife liane ( diane venora ) demands of him what are they supposed to do for income . meanwhile the 60 minutes team trying to do a story on fires started by cigarettes have obtained some data they do not understand . they offer wigand $ 12 , 000 just to interpret the data . wigand \\' s severance agreement swears him to secrecy about anything he knows about tobacco dealings , but he is reluctantly he stretches the severance terms . he is willing to read some documents from another tobacco company and interpret them for bergman . in spite of the secrecy , wigand \\' s former employers seem immediately to know wigand is talking to 60 minutes and he is warned off by former boss thomas sandefur played michael gambon in an all too brief but deliciously sinister role . and so the game begins . wigand is irate at his negative treatment for what he still considered continued to be loyalty to his agreement and his former employer . meanwhile someone is playing very rough with wigand and his family . the film examines wigand and the pressures placed on his family as they are caught between two powerful giants . wigand has always wanted to make tobacco safer and has natural sympathies with getting the story out . he and his family are assaulted psychologically and financially by the giant tobacco industry that had never lost a legal fight . al pacino is given top billing but the wigand family is the core of the insider . the story is told slowly and in just a bit too much meticulous detail . the film is 157 minutes and is an extremely demanding film for the audience . the musical score by pieter bourke , lisa gerrard , and graeme revell is one of the worst in recent memory . it puts ominous chords under some scenes and using voice in ways that become a distraction that gets in the way of the storytelling . also disturbing is the casting of christopher plummer as mike wallace . plummer and wallace are such different types and wallace is too well - known for even so good an actor as plummer to play him convincingly . this film might have been a really engaging experience under another director \\' s control . michael mann was the wrong person to helm this film and the insider lacks intensity because of his style . i rate it a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the - 4 to + 4 scale .',\n",

purports to be a comedy exploring the relationship between men and women satirizing the whole pop - psychology mars / venus phenomenon . but what this movie winds up being is a collection of unfunny cringe - inducing moments coupled with uninsightful cringe - inducing moments ; the end result is , unsurprisingly , an unfunny , uninsightful , cringe - inducing , thoroughly icky embarrassment . garry shandling plays an alien from a planet populated by technologically advanced but emotionally vacant males ( they reproduce through cloning , of course ) . his leaders put a select group of males through a series of tests designed to determine which one is most fit to fly off to earth , find a female of the species , and impregnate her . they \\' re taught how to pretend that they \\' re listening by nodding and saying \" uh - huh , \" and how to compliment shoes . imagine my delighted surprise when , oh heavens , all their carefully practiced tactics turn out to fail miserably , producing comedic results ! the lucky winner is fitted with a penis ( since theirs , after generations of disuse have long since shrunk out of existence . . . i will restrain myself from mentioning the implausibility of such a scenario since the population has stopped evolving due to the fact that they \\' re all just clones . . . whoops , too late . ) the penis , when aroused , tends to make a humming noise . the writers , when frequently strapped for ideas , tend to turn to this as a source of \" comedy . \" it isn \\' t funny the first time . it isn \\' t funny the eighth time . it isn \\' t funny the eighteenth time . if anything , it made me feel vaguely self - conscious . garry meets up with a coworker at a bank played by greg kinnear , who turns out to be a generic , unlikable scumbag . he \\' s meant to fill the part of unfortunate role model for shandling \\' s alien character , but he \\' s so flatly drawn that even the writers quickly give up and toss him aside . kinnear \\' s scumbagginess is demonstrated by the fact that he claims other peoples \\' work as his own to worm his way into a vice presidents \\' position and goes to aa meetings to pick up chicks . wow . what a magnificent bastard . nearly every man in the movie , in fact , is played as the same sort of sex - driven slimeball . when kinnear \\' s wife walks into the office , there isn \\' t a single guy who doesn \\' t trip , bump into a wall , or otherwise pratfall as if they \\' d never seen a woman before . the few guys that aren \\' t particularly slimeballs , such as john goodman \\' s detective character , are simply uncommunicative workaholics . shandling meets up with annette bening , who will inevitably prove to be the love he never knew existed , at one of kinnear \\' s aa meetings . shandling \\' s mission is to have a baby , and when he reveals his desires to her , bening instantly falls for him , and the next day . . . they get married . yup . the next day . cuz ya see , it turns out she wants a baby too ! bening \\' s character perhaps was the most difficult to watch , especially after seeing her come apart at the seams so effectively in american beauty . . . if her character here is supposed to be representing the female of the species as a whole , then woe , i say , to the species . she \\' s unfathomably insecure , and succumbs so easily to all of shandling \\' s lines and lies that it borders on tragic . there \\' s a point where , after thinking she may not be able to bear children , she learns that she is indeed pregnant . when garry comes home after nearly cheating on her , she strolls into the kitchen and sings \" high hopes \" ( you know , the uplifting ant and the rubber tree plant song ) to deliver the news , and then says to him , \" now you can \\' t leave me . \" we \\' re supposed to empathize with shandling \\' s discovery of the feeling of \" guilt , \" but instead i wanted to weep for bening that she was placing her entire life and soul firmly in the lap of a great big nothing . and eventually , shandling falls in love with her . . . for real , i suppose , though i \\' m not sure exactly what prompted it . what \\' s the message i derive from all this ? men are liars , inherently empty creatures , but if you hang around long enough . . . well , maybe something will click . ha ha . . . ha ? i \\' m thankful such broad cynicism isn \\' t frequently allowed to run so rampant . let \\' s all join hands and pray that the planet these folks are from is not this one . there \\' s also a subplot involving john goodman as an airline incident investigator that wades in the bog of stupidity . goodman , through a series of astoundingly implausible realizations , puts together the fact that shandling is a being from another world with a magic , vibrating penis . it has all the makings for a subplot of having shandling be discovered , that , thankfully , never comes to the inevitable hackneyed fruition . instead , it just dangles limply on the branch for a while , withers , and falls away . further proof that goodman should just stick to doing coen brothers movies . but let \\' s not dwell on this any longer , i \\' ve already wasted plenty of your time and my own . let \\' s move on , forget about what we \\' ve seen here , and get on with our lives . and to help us out , let \\' s end things on a happy note . . . congratuations go out to annette bening , winner of this week \\' s \" title ! \" award , for delivering the awkward line of dialog containing the movie \\' s name .',\n",

              " (\"apparently , director tony kaye had a major battle with new line regarding his new film , american history x . i don ' t know the details of the fight , but it seems that he is not happy with the final product , and nearly removed his name from the credits altogether . i ' ve heard about this kind of thing happening before , and it makes me wonder how much input a studio has over the films they produce . as it is , i found american history x to be an extremely good film , not just because of tony kaye ' s focused look at the touchy subject of racism , but because of a powerful , charismatic performance from edward norton . it ' s hard to believe that it has only been two years since norton ' s fantastic role in primal fear , but , here he is now , starring in his own film and making himself a star . norton is one of those performers who becomes his character , and his work in american history x is one of the very best performances this year . he plays a young man named derek vinyard , a skinhead living in venice beach with his brother , danny ( edward furlong ) , mother ( beverly d ' angelo ) , and sister , davin ( jennifer lien ) . the film opens with a flashback , in which derek brutally kills two black men vandalizing his car . we find out that this lands him in prison , and the film from that point is seen through the eyes of danny . in the present - time of the film , danny is in high school , and eager to follow the footsteps of his brother . much of the film is told in flashback , and we see the path that leads to derek ' s adoption of white supremacy . when derek is released , having served three years in prison , he finds that his brother is now a full - blown skinhead ; derek , however , has given up the violence , and tries to get his brother to understand why racism and the violence that comes with it are bad things . what makes this all interesting is that these two young men are not stupid , thoughtless people -- they are intelligent and articulate , and voice their beliefs in disturbingly straightforward terms . it ' s hard to make a controversial movie and not preach , but kaye has found the right note for his material . because american history x is a mainstream film , there has to be a redemption phase for our main character -- some people may think that this is the only way to make him sympathetic . i partially disagree with this , because , although i do not advocate racism in any way , it ' s interesting the way kaye presents derek -- he is a loud , obnoxious man , but he ' s also very smart . the reasons for why he becomes a skinhead are believable -- his father was arbitrarily killed by a group of black men . it ' s clear that he ' s passionate about his beliefs , and that he ' s not just a punk looking for an excuse to beat people up . of course , it helps that kaye has an actor as talented as norton to play this part . it ' s astonishing how frightening norton looks with a shaved head and a swastika on his chest . in addition to getting the look just right , he ' s perfect for this role -- derek requires intelligence , depth , and a whole lot of shouting , and norton does it all with ease . even when he ' s at his meanest , derek has a likable quality to him , and that ' s a gutsy approach when telling a story about a skinhead . what adds depth to the story is a subplot in which the principal of danny ' s school ( avery brooks ) becomes obsessed with purging the hatred from danny . the other performances are all terrific , with standouts from furlong , d ' angelo , and lien . visually , the film is very powerful . kaye indulges in a lot of interesting artistic choices , and most of them work nicely -- lots of slow - motion and strange camera angles add to a moody atmosphere . but , like a lot of movies lately , american history x skims past greatness in the last few minutes . although the climactic scene is very moving , the picture ends with a pretentious , preachy resolution featuring a brief narration from a character who was killed . for a movie so smart a subtle up until that point , it felt like a slap in the face to be hand - fed a theme in such a simplistic way . it makes me wonder what , exactly , tony kaye disliked about the final version of his film . perhaps this last scene was the problem . it ' s hard to imagine any director not being at least partially pleased with a film this good -- in a time when so many movies are timid and weak , american history x manages to make a compelling argument for racism without advocating it any way .\",\n",

( ironically , it was within these past ten years that \" reality - based \" television have become a predominant fixture into our culture . who knew ? ) one - upping niccol , it was when unlikely candidate - director peter weir took the helm that things fell into place . weir had the nearly impossible task to create the unimitible tone , deftly mixing capra with kafka , throwing george bailey in a universe inhabited by rod serling . it was weir \\' s first stroke of genius to create seahaven : a suburban paradise / prison that would make spielberg cower in shame . for example , bystander - extras would walk around the block incessantly with flowers along with the latest issue of _dog fancy_ . the nicest touch are the plethora of subtle hints for truman to _not_ leave the island . credit weir for his second stroke : the casting of carrey . carrey seems to be the type of character actor who would always turn \" on \" and act goofy whenever the camera is near . not here . his performance is so subverted you sometimes wonder if he is ever aware the camera is on . and although carrey does not deserve an academy award nomination ( just as well , the academy rarely honors goofy comedians , excepting robin williams ) , he stretches enough to alter his hyper - silly image considerably . playing one who has the cameras constantly invading his most intimate moments turns to be quite the role of jim carrey \\' s life . no pun intended . better in a smaller , more pivotal role is ed harris as christof , who mixes the right amount of his apollo 13 \" work the problem , people \" character with dustin hoffman \\' s megaglomaniac producer in _wag the dog_ , and then only slightly svengalian . it is clear that he is torn between the nielson ratings and truman \\' s well being . yes , in his own misguided way he loves truman as a father to a son , and has provided the best universe he could provide . he thinks . rounding out the cast is natascha mcelhone ( mrs . dalloway ) as carrey \\' s true \" forbidden love \" , sylvia , very effective in another pivotal small role . laura linney ( congo ) and noah emmerich ( copland ) have the unfortunate task of playing truman \\' s wife and best friend ; their sitcom - ish dialogue allow little room for any authentic character development . the exception is at the very beginning , where they speak into the camera , wholeheartedly believing that their participation is truly good for truman , and for society in general . there are other little problems with the script . are we to assume that toddler truman had no recollection of hearing the construction of such a gigantic dome during his formative years ? was there any reason as to why in one scene , it rained solely on truman , even though it never had to ? how is it they hire hundreds of extras , and none of them could drive a boat , and yet truman , fearful of water , is helming a sailboat effortlessly ? and couldn \\' t christof have turned off the wind , to strand truman at sea ? these little contrivances , however , do not hold a candle to the overall effect of the work . the audience gets the feeling that it is watching the actual show , and we are drawn to truman \\' s mundane existence for no other reason than it is there . the final result effortlessly combines the emotional happy ending of a mainstream picture with a gnawing discomfort that hits you square in the gut . upon leaving the theater , i was looking up in the sky , wondering if it was nothing more than a gigantic dome . just checking .',\n",

              " ('director david fincher has such an eye for detail which is very rare in hollywood these days ( terry gilliam comes to mind as another one ) . film is one of the best art forms because not only can you tell a story , but you can use the camera to capture the smallest detail and have it mean something . but most directors seem to go for action with the slightest ounce of a story . so whenever a director uses the camera to its fullest potential , the film almost automatically deserves a good review . and when they add a fascinating story to it , you have nearly perfect entertainment . fincher \\' s the game is no exception to this . the game is one of the most interesting and complex films to come out of hollywood in a long time . fincher hasn \\' t made a film since \" seven , \" his box office and critical hit which defied expectations and became one of the best movies ever . so it is about time he made another film . and what a ride it is . the game isn \\' t quite as powerful as \" seven , \" but in some ways it is better . overall , the game could have used a little more clarity , or a little more uncertainty . it walks a line of insanity and reality , but it never goes either way until the very end . the outcome is satisfying enough for the preceding events , and it makes a lot of sense once everything is set straight . unfortunately , unlike \" the usual suspects , \" we are never given enough information to figure out for ourselves what is happening , whether it be true or false . however , this also gives the film a frightening aspect which the game uses to the fullest extent . the game is told completely from its main character \\' s point of view . nicholas van orton ( michael douglas ) is a high - strung and isolated businessman . he lives alone in his giant mansion , divorced from his wife elizabeth , and is celebrating his 48th birthday ; the same age at which his father committed suicide at , in the same mansion . for his 48th birthday , conrad ( sean penn ) , the rebel of the family , gives nicholas a gift certificate to crs : consumer recreation services . \" it will make your life fun again , \" his brother promises . as skeptical as nicholas is , he is somewhat intrigued , and annoyed by the lack of information -- something this businessman hates . seeing a billboard in an office , he decides to visit the mysterious company . jim feingold ( james rebhorn ) greets nicholas and guides him through the sign - up process , which consists of psych - tests , physicals , emotional responses , and other mind games . \" each game is suited to each person \\' s emotional and psychological needs , \" explains feingold . one day , nicholas gets a call from crs and they explain that he failed the tests . even more intrigued and now somewhat angered at the time he spent signing up , he starts asking around to see what people can tell him about the company . what he doesn \\' t realize is that the game has already begun . the phone call is just the first of many strange events to be thrown nicholas \\' way . how he finds out that he is involved has to be witnessed because it is amusing and fun and visually impressive . the detail involved in fincher \\' s shots is incredible and almost requires a second viewing just to appreciate the effort that went into them . with \" seven , \" fincher had almost every single shot mean something . he also has the unique ability to make you look at exactly what he wants you to . compared to \" seven , \" though , the game is light and comical . because of this film \\' s sense of humor and self - awareness , nothing can be taken quite seriously . so don \\' t try to make much sense of what goes on in the game , because it doesn \\' t want you to . what does make sense is the final revelation -- when everything becomes apparent and clear . if taken as it is , the game \\' s ending makes complete sense . but if you try and critique every minute detail , then you get yourself into plot holes and incredibility . perhaps that is the reason i docked the film . while trying to remain realistic and plausible , the plot is too unbelievable to create any real tension on screen . we don \\' t really care if douglas \\' character lives or not because it isn \\' t believable . the ending requires you to have believed anything that has happened previously , but if you suspend disbelief and take the film as it is , you can accept the game as an emotionally and psycholically disturbing thriller . michael douglas gives a terrific performance as nicholas . douglas has played lonely businessmen before , but here he adds another level to his performance . his character , who is normally level - headed and relies on facts , is forced to trust nobody . can he believe the waitress he bumped into ? what about his brother who got him involved in the game in the first place ? douglas portrays this aspect of his character extremely well , and gives one of his best performances ( even better than his \" falling down \" persona ) . the supporting cast is essential in this film , and casting was critical . sean penn is always good , and he gives yet another credible performance as douglas \\' brother . deborah kara unger ( from \" crash \" ) is the waitress he bumps into , and her performance is extremely good . in fact , she almost steals the film from douglas . james rebhorn portrays his character very well , and adds some confusion and desparation to douglas \\' predicament . another good performance comes from armin mueller - stahl ( from \" shine \" ) as the book editor . but considering that douglas is in every single scene of the game , he not only commands this cast , but makes this distant and lonely character come to colorful life . the game is rated r for language , violence , some gore , and some nudity and drugs . what is essential for this film to work is the writing . john brancato and michael ferris have woven a confusing and compelling screenplay with witty dialogue , and some very funny moments . this screenplay will probably get an oscar nomination for best original screenplay because it does almost exactly the same thing the usual suspects \\' did . however , the visuals of the game are enough to make the viewer enjoy the vexing plot . and if you can get yourself to believe everything occuring on the screen , you will be thoroughly entertained by one of this year \\' s best films .',\n",

( 1 ) don \\' t let a television actress - turned - comedy movie director near an urbanite script ( i . e . , penny marshall \\' s dreadful \" preacher \\' s wife \" ) . betty thomas worked wonders with \" the brady bunch movie \" , but the same sitcom - airiness doesn \\' t quite work here . it \\' s as if she lifted a generic sitcom , and iced it with light doses of modern r & b . take away the black cast , take away the atrocious soundtrack , and you have the residue of some mid - 80 \\' s kirk cameron show . ( 2 ) the greater the cast , the less the individual cast - member has to do ( i . e . , \" con air \" ) . it is great to have the comic voices of jenna elfman , garry schandling , john leguizimo , ellen degeneres , and gilbert godfried in your lineup , but they have nothing to do but improvise their underdeveloped , stereotyped characters , one - line - at - a - time . it \\' s even worse , because sometimes their voices are so unrecognizable that you don \\' t get the satisfaction of linking the voice to the comedian until the credits . now there are three character actors who do get special treatment : albert brooks brings dignity to nearly every project he \\' s in , and the scenes as a depressed tiger do resonate a certain poignancy . norm mcdonald fares nearly as well , as a stray dog who learns to bond with dolittle . but there \\' s little humor here . that rests on the shoulders of chris rock , sorely miscast and unfunny as the voice of their wise - ass guinea pig . even the mouth is ill - synched . ( 3 ) don \\' t let the special effects technicians walk away with the script . there \\' s a certain timing that \\' s mandatory in comedy . to have this timing usurped by the brilliancy of computer generated mouths or lifelike creations of jim henson \\' s creature shop , is a travesty . this is not to say that special effects filled comedies or muppet movies aren \\' t well - timed laughfests ; with the right director , they can be and have . here , betty thomas is clearly over her head . i wish i could commend the special effects , but they \\' re merely average . count the number of times where the animal \\' s mouth is turned away from the camera , or too far to notice , or ill - synched . this is less a \" babe \" and more of a \" look who \\' s barking \" clone . you may be wondering , \\' how does eddie murphy fare ? \\' well , he came back with the exceptional \" nutty professor \" , and i don \\' t doubt he can come back again . here , he \\' s tied into a straight man and given little to do . the exceptions are when he fears he \\' s going crazy : a far cry from his smarter - than - you \\' d expect routine that he \\' s more adept at . it \\' s unfortunate that he is where richard pryor was ten years ago , making lame comedies without the same bite he had given in his early years . after all this , what \\' s left ? butt jokes . a _lot_ of butt jokes . i guess for kids that may be funny , but i was stone - faced . if there \\' s a lesson the film may be telling us , is that animals have feelings too , and they care way too much for your butt .',\n",

              " ('reindeer games is easily the worst of the three recent films penned by ehren kruger ( scream 3 and arlington rd are the others , each derivative in their own special way ) . the guy can \\' t seem to write believable dialogue ( sample from reindeer games : \" rule # 1 : never put a car thief behind the wheel \" ) , create multi - faceted characters , or even engineer coherent plots but he sure knows how to pile on numerous nonsensical twists and turns ( no matter if each one deems the actual story increasingly unlikely ) . his screenplay for reindeer games turns the tables on the audience so many times that watching the film becomes something of a punishment with no reward anywhere in sight . i can just envision kruger laughing behind his keyboard , \" oh you thought my movie was gonna go here , f * ck you jack ass , take that twist , decipher this mother f * cker ! \" it \\' s almost as if the writer were angry at us for shelling out money to see his stupid movie . and why the hell would anyone want to invest time in a movie when the screenwriter keeps changing his own rules for no reason other than to congratulate himself on how damn clever he is ? auteur theory be damned ; it \\' s kruger \\' s \" style \" , not the director \\' s that winds up on screen . kruger has obviously never paid much mind to the old chestnut \" sometimes less is more \" . and his numerous twists can \\' t even claim to be originals ; arlington rd \\' s ending is a direct steal from the much better alan j . pakula thriller the parallax view , and in reindeer games we get this ol \\' gem ; character incriminates themself by saying something they shouldn \\' t know ( pronouns used to protect the gender of the \" character \" . . . grammar be damned ) . \" how did you know that ? \" the stunned protagonist asks , suddenly realizing that the character was in on the whole thing all along . . . since twist endings are currently so in vogue , and seeing as how kruger \\' s screenplays usually come equipped with about three twists per ending , i guess it \\' s no wonder why he works so frequently . he \\' s quickly becoming miramax \\' s mickey mouse ; the company has already signed him to work on several of their upcoming projects . this is appropriate considering that miramax ( which used to place their label on some of the most artistically daring films ) has quickly become a grindhouse for coddling foreign imports ( life is beautiful ) and freddie prinze jr . vehicles . their company \\' s current logo could be \" we ride the trends \" . reindeer games stars ben affleck as rudy , a supposedly hardened criminal spending his days and nights behind bars with fantasies of pecan pies dancing atop his head . although affleck is given some barbed wire tattoos to insinuate bad assness , he plays the role like steve guttenberg preciously mugging through a police academy flick . affleck is such a puppy dog that it \\' s impossible to believe he could survive in a harsh prison environment without becoming nearly everyone \\' s bitch . the role itself is so badly written ( the character only grows balls when the plot calls for it ) , the twists so outrageous , and the directing so self consciously gritty that this is about as close to self parody as i can recall a recent \" serious \" movie getting . it may have been wiser had the film makers simply went all the way in that direction , casting jerry seinfeld as the hardened criminal and howard stern as the sniveling bad guy ( who \\' s played here by gary sinise in yet another over the top villain performance ) james frain is nick , rudy \\' s cellmate , a manslaughterer who \\' s found a pen pal in the gorgeous ashley mason ( charlize theron ) . ashley is a prison groupie who sends nick many cheesecake photos of her though she \\' s never seen one picture of him . which works out fine since the character is killed in a near - riot , and rudy ( who was to be paroled on the same day as nick ) takes his place , which leads to a sudden and very frenzied sex scene between ashley and rudy ( so frenzied it kinda looks like rape ) and a surprise visit from ashley \\' s brother , gabriel ( gary sinise ) , who waltzes into their shabby hotel room flanked by his thuggish co - horts . he plans to rob an indian casino on christmas eve with the assistance of rudy who he thinks is nick who , according to what he wrote in the letters to ashley , used to work as a guard in the indian casino . though by the end , the film pulls the rug out from under us so frequently that everything i \\' ve described might as well be irrelevant . this is what you can expect should you chose to take this reindeer on ; several scenes in which , after catching his prey , the bad guy proceeds to stall interminably until the good guy has a chance to kill his captor and crack a stupid one - liner . included : two ( 2 ) scenes of two ( 2 ) different bad guys explaining their motives to the hero when they should be killing him ( one following the other no less ) . though it \\' s an action film , the ending is more a talkfest where we get the whole movie explained to us by one flustered character actor after another while affleck looks on , incredulous as the audience . the flick was directed by john frankenheimer , a straightforward action director who lucked into the manchurian candidate early in his career , fell off the a - list following a string of flops and now , in his old age , is slowly climbing his way back up . it would be a success story if he were choosing better scripts but his last major film was ronin ( one of those almost but not quite movies ) which followed the island of dr . morneau ( you remember , the one with marlon brando in mime make - up and a not so flattering moo - moo ) , and now this . he films action sequences with a minimum of quick cutting which i like considering that nowadays action scenes are commonly comprised of millisecond flash cuts strung together and laid out for a brain - zapped mtv audience to pick apart . problem is these action scenes ( nearly all failed escapes ) serve no purpose in the story other than to further pad out the running time and to remind the audience that their watching an action movie rather than a filmed radio play . character problems abound ; rudy is made to shift between sweet boy next door earnestness and hard edged wiseacre , the latter of which is not ( at least at this point ) something ben affleck is capable of pulling off . the former he can do with ease and often the actor coasts on his lackadaisical charm while those around him growl and swear . but then suddenly affleck starts growling and swearing alongside them like the class clown imitating a tarantino gangster . charlize theron , an extraordinary talent , is , like affleck , playing whatever part the script requires her to play , whether it be vulnerability at one moment , anger at the next . she never has a chance to evince any charm or make much of an impression beyond her obvious physical attributes ( frankenheimer has her needlessly pop her top to further italicize this . gary sinise has played this role frequently , and here , as in snake eyes , he does the snarling bad guy thing with such over the top vitriol ( the guy must be so incredibly bored of stomping through the same paces that going out of control is the only thing that keeps him interested any more ) , that it becomes more of an annoyance ( oh there he goes again ? ? ? ) than a threat . these are talented people who made the mistake of jumping on to a script with little but stock characters and a bag of tricks that it dully springs on its audience .',\n",

              " ('according to hollywood movies made in last few decades , life in small town is one of the worst things that could happen to a human being . even worse fate awaits those who were unfortunate to grow up in those dark , god - forsaken places and later forced to live forever traumatised by the experience . on the other hand , it seems that something more than atlantic ocean divides europe from america , because one of the most popular and beloved european films takes exactly the opposite view . this film is amarcord , 1974 comedy by famous italian director federico fellini , which later gave inspiration to numerous imitations and homages , and even led few american screen artists to adopt its heretical views about benefits of small town life . the film is based on the screenplay by fellini and tonino guerra and it lacks the plot in usual sense . instead we follow one year in 1930s italian summer resort town of rimini through the series of short vignettes that depict various local events and customs , as well as series of local , often very colourful characters . although many of those characters occasionally take the role of narrator , movie concentrates on its nominal protagonist , 14 - year old boy titta ( played by bruno zanin ) and chronicles his sexual frustrations , obsession with local beauty queen named gradisca ( played by magali noel ) , problems in his lovingly dysfunctional family , as well as troubles his father ( played by armando brancia ) have with mussolini \\' s fascist regime . amarcord was often noted as the ultimate nostalgia film , and it probably explains why it is very popular , even among those people who actually don \\' t like federico fellini \\' s work very much . every member of its potential audience would find part of himself or herself in this film , because fellini in this film clearly illustrates natural human desire to paint past in the best way possible . distortion between actual past and its subjective interpretation could be found even in the title of the film - word \" amarcord \" is nothing more than badly pronounced phrase \" i remember \" in local italian dialect . in the same way the word is distorted , so is the past in memories of those who remember it . after the premiere , fellini rejected any claims about autobiographical character of this film , but it doesn \\' t matter whether rimini of amarcord actually resembles rimini of fellini \\' s childhood or not ; any place and any time could resemble characters and situations of this film . fellini \\' s views on nostalgia are clearly illustrated with a way he mixes reality and fantasy in this film . even the most naturalistic scenes are laced with dark humour and grotesque images . characters look like caricatures , actors playing them often deliberately overact , and women , especially those who fuel titta \\' s sexual fantasies , often have certain body parts with gargantuan proportions . every now and then , scenes that depict 1930s reality gradually slide into fantasies of movie \\' s characters and rimini becomes almost indistinguishable from the magical place in characters \\' visions . because of that , almost everything in this film looks different , and in most cases better , than it would have looked in the real life . even the fascism gets fellinian make - over - fellini views mussolini \\' s totalitarian regime as nothing more than visual spectacle ( explaining why similar regimes enjoyed such popular support throughout history ) and opportunity for comedy . when fascists finally show their true colours and begin torturing their opponents , even this becomes opportunity for scenes of macabre humour . unlike many of his italian colleagues in 1970s , who had used 1930s period setting to explicitly condemn fascism and serve fashionable political agenda , fellini doesn \\' t care that much about politics . lack of self - righteous moral perspective is compensated with fellini \\' s humanistic approach to his characters . each of them , regardless of age , gender , social class or physical appearance , is given opportunity to express his or her views , dreams and fears . fellini treats all those characters with warmth and affection , even when he paints them as grotesque caricatures of real people . because of this warmth and democratic spirit , amarcord could be viewed as one of the most humane films of 20th century , and it keeps its general feel good atmosphere despite depicting having many uncomfortable , melancholic and even tragic moments . fellini couldn \\' t produce such effects without using his own directorial talent that gave a very personal touch to this movie . vignettes aren \\' t memorable because of the characters only ; fellini uses camera , painting film in bright colours , especially in the scenes that depict character \\' s fantasies . fellini also knows how to use locations , whether such location happens to be luxurious hotel , bright - coloured beach or rural countryside . even the down - to - earth streets of rimini , where everyone knows everyone , gets magical dimension during the snowfall . on the other hand , lack of credible special effects somewhat diminished the same effect during the ocean liner scene . this atmosphere is also provided by incredible talent of composer and fellini \\' s long - time associate nino rota . his amarcord theme is probably one of the most recognisable , most popular and most relaxing and uplifting pieces of film music ever produced . that music alone should be the reason to view amarcord as one of the indisputable classics of seventh art .',\n",

( witness the quick deaths of buddy , born to be wild and congo . ) and while this latest entry is inoffensive and watchable , it \\' s also an assembly line product through and through , lacking the charm and unpredictability of the jungle serials that partly inspired it . theron is jill young : as a young girl in the wilds of africa , she befriended a baby gorilla after both their mothers were slain by poachers . that baby gorilla ( nicknamed joe ) grows to immense proportions , and adult jill basically bides her time looking after him , playing hide and seek with him and guarding him against poachers . enter conservationist greg ( paxton ) , who convinces jill to move with joe to california , where they can protect him better in a controlled environment . joe is restless at first ; no sooner does he finally settle in to the new place than those nasty poachers show up in l . a . , plotting joe \\' s demise . suffice it to say , the movie could have been called \" joe : ape in the city . \" theron ( so good in devil \\' s advocate ) and paxton ( so good in the recent a simple plan ) are fine actors , but not fine enough to transcend the material , a paint - by - numbers script from the hack writers of superman iv and mercury rising . the plot arguably borrows more from steven spielberg \\' s the lost world than the 1949 original , with the computer - generated t - rex - i mean , joe - wreaking havoc on the busy streets for an encore ; the storytelling becomes especially lazy during this final third , with jill shouting , \" look , joe \\' s headed for the movie theatre ! \" followed by a shot of joe scaling mann \\' s chinese theater ; a moment later , jill shouts again something like \" look , joe \\' s headed for an amusement park ! \" and what do you know , there \\' s joe at the pallisades carnival , scaring the bejesus out of innocent thrillseekers . the seams of last - minute edits to mighty joe young show - unrelated scenes are patched together with quick dissolves . the movie sure feels uneven , regardless : act two is underdeveloped , while a little of joe smashing cars in act three goes a long , long way . underwood ( tremors , speechless ) was perhaps not the director for the job ; even the plentiful , untamed landscape looks dull in his hands . ( capturing the beauty of nature requires more than his point and shoot style . ) i did enjoy certain sequences , especially the demoliton of a black - tie dinner sequence ; and the prologue , however implausible , is touching . ( as a tyke , joe acts just like e . t . ) rick baker \\' s make - up effects and puppetry are outstanding , the real star of the show - yet , for all its technical flawlessness , the creature remains too grumpy and homicidal to love . ( his facial expressions are variations on a scowl . ) to be fair , i saw mighty joe young in a cinema packed with wailing children - it \\' s a wonder i was able to decipher the dialogue . it \\' s certainly not a film for very young kids - intense fighting scenes may scare them , while any time joe \\' s not on camera may bore them to tears . ( note : older boys are more likely to be dazzled by theron \\' s colourful array of tank tops . ) i suspect bland mighty joe young is passable entertainment for a family outing , but they sure don \\' t make ? em like they used to .',\n",

              " ('known as the most successful , highest - grossing romantic comedy in history , director garry marshall apparently struck gold with \" pretty woman , \" which opened quietly during the summer of 1990 but , thanks to positive word - of - mouth , was able to reach upwards of $ 175 - million in theaters alone . the question of why it worked so well lies directly with the film \\' s two charismatic stars , richard gere and julia roberts , since the story itself is none too original or even believable . the other winning element that makes \" pretty woman \" so entertaining is its genuine sweetness and innocence , which is rarely as palpable in today \\' s films as it is here . edward lewis ( richard gere ) is a suave , extremely wealthy business mogul who , at the start of the picture , breaks up with his girlfriend over the phone after a nasty argument , and abruptly takes his friend \\' s car and gets lost on hollywood boulevard while trying to find his hotel . stopping the car along the street , he asks a woman , obviously a prostitute , for directions . agreeing to get in his car and show him for ten bucks , edward ultimately accepts , they strike up a conversation , and before long she has been asked up to his penthouse room on the top floor . this meeting does not lead to sex , however , as edward confides that he \\' d rather just have someone to talk to , and offers her $ 300 to spend the night . just as well , since the hooker , named vivian , is a beautiful , generally upbeat young woman who is the type of person that can lend an understanding ear . the meeting between these two completely opposite people does not end the next morning as planned , when edward finally offers to pay vivian three - thousand dollars if she will stay with him for six days and nights while he is in the area , keeping him company and acting as his companion to business dinners and get - togethers . since vivian firmly tells edward at the beginning that she will do anything with him except kiss him on the lips , which always leads to unwanted intimacy when dealing with her customers , the obligatory rule of the genre says that by the third act , edward and vivian will finally , truly , kiss . allegedly planned as a grim , downbeat drama until garry marshall came on board as director , \" pretty woman \" has been transformed in all senses of the word into a classic fairy tale , a la \" cinderella . \" the premise is hardly believable and its portrait of prostitutes hanging out on the streets of hollywood boulevard is just about the most idealized portrayal that there could have possibly been . you honestly don \\' t need a high - iq ( or any iq , for that matter ) to guess how the film will end , and the story is as old as my great great grandma bertha . the supporting characters are almost all sketchily written and less - than - gratifying , and the screenplay is no award winner . and yet , amidst all of these qualms and flaws , \" pretty woman \" is an astoundingly charming motion picture , and it is definately easy to see why it became such an overnight sensation with moviegoers . you \\' d actually be amazed how far bemusement can go , and there are a few select moments ( not even whole scenes , mind you ) that are as romantic as anything i \\' ve seen on film in the 1990 \\' s . additionally , the film belongs , and its success can be attributed , to two people and two people only , and they are richard gere and julia roberts . playing sex symbols throughout the \\' 80s with such pictures as \" american gigolo \" and \" an officer and a gentleman , \" gere branches out here to play a more quiet , almost shy , but still alluring , character that believably could sweep julia roberts off her feet , and vice versa . julia roberts , in her breakthrough role after 1988 \\' s well - received \" mistic pizza \" and 1989 \\' s \" steel magnolia , \" for which she was nominated for an academy award , is radiant and funny as the wordly vivian , who surprisingly could be a role model for impressionistic viewers , not for her line of work , but more for her sheer intelligence . it would have probably been easy to have written vivian as merely a flake , but screenwriter j . f . lawton clearly cared too much about his central characters to do such a thing . after \" pretty woman , \" roberts , along with meg ryan , became the reigning queen of romantic comedies ( with her latest being the just - released \" runaway bride , \" which repairs gere and roberts together once again ) , and no wonder . roberts has continually proven to not only be a strong actress with a flare for comedy , but also one who can efficiently do drama , and in almost every film she appears in , it is difficult not to fall in love with her along with her male co - star . an especially strong scene that gere and roberts do together takes place after edward foolishly tells one of his co - workers that vivian is actually a prostitute , and he then approaches her , making sexual advances . no only does this make vivian feel cheap , especially since she had previously been posing as a more professional , eloquent young lady , but it also maddens her that edward would demean and betray her in such a way , and ultimately causes her to question where exactly her life is leading , and if she likes this particular path . on the more dreamy side , the film is filled with romantic scenes that are simply effervescent to behold , especially one in which edward enters into the hotel \\' s lounge to see vivian turn around and not only reveal her marvelous cocktail dress , but also her inner ( and outer ) glowing beauty . another subtle moment has vivian lovingly blowing a kiss to edward , who is asleep , and placing it on his lips , since she still is unsure if she should be getting attached to this man who may very well be out of her life forever in a short couple of days . \" pretty woman \" does not blatantly step wrong until the very last scene , which is a happy ending ( as you \\' d expect , and wouldn \\' t have it any other way ) that somehow does not work , perhaps because of its undeniable contrivances . this one misstep does not put a damper on the rest of the film , though , because there is just far too much magic at work here to disaffirm such a petty problem . helped along by a warm , memorable supporting performance from laura san giacomo , as vivian \\' s best friend and roommate , and a fabulously catchy soundtrack , in which all of the songs prominently aid in the movie \\' s overall fulfillment , \" pretty woman \" is a sparkler of a motion picture , and has what it takes to act as a blueprint on how to make the quintessential romantic comedy .',\n",

\" is less of a letdown than it could be , and knowingly offers a wink and nod at past unmasking scenes . ( \" nice twist , \" quips the killer . \" didn \\' t see it coming , didya ? \" ) one senses , however , that , by the end of this picture , the overall concept of a hip , self - referential slasher film has been played out . supposedly , there \\' s going to be a scream 3 , but , if the film makers don \\' t come up with something radical , we could end up with a classic case of sequel overkill .',\n",

              " ('the police negotiator is the person with the entirely unenviable job of going into ground zero and attempting to talk a dangerous criminal out of doing whatever he or she intends to do . lives are often at stake , and the criminal is usually armed and most likely mentally unstable , prone to turn on the negotiator at a moment \\' s notice . the negotiator must therefore be something of an actor , psychologist , and sham artist , in addition to being a police officer ; he must be able to think on his feet and either work toward the goal of ending the confrontation without violence , or failing that , must be prepared to facilitate the conclusion of the crisis through firepower . most of all , the negotiator must be able to enter a situation with as little intelligence about the scenario as possible , and quickly gain control of the situation , dominate the conversation , and influence the perpetrator into thinking that the end of the conflict is what he really wants . it takes a pretty smart person to do that . but what if the hostage - holding criminal is just as smart ? what if he \\' s also able to think on his feet ? in fact , what if he also knows all the tricks to turning the situation to his favor ? it is this circumstance which forms the basis for f . gary gray \\' s the negotiator . in this film , police negotiator danny roman ( samuel l . jackson ) is tipped off by his partner to corruption within the chicago police force . when his partner turns up shot to death and internal affairs finds incriminating evidence in roman \\' s home , roman becomes the prime suspect of both embezzling from the police disability fund and murder . faced with the scorn of most of the police department , and under close scrutiny by the media , roman is forced to turn in his badge in one of those typical scenes in the captain \\' s office . i don \\' t quite remember if the captain actually said , \" i hate to do this , but . . . \" , although it wouldn \\' t surprise me if he did . luckily , the film soon shakes off the conventionalism and concentrates on the interesting premise mentioned above . after being offered a take - it - or - leave - it deal by the district attorney , roman resolves to prove his innocence by walking into the office of internal affairs inspector niebaum ( j . t . walsh ) , taking him and others hostage , and proclaiming he has been framed . although roman \\' s actions seem forced due to the compressed nature of his motivational build - up , gray redeems himself by involving us with the negotiations between roman and fellow police negotiator chris sabian ( kevin spacey ) which soon ensue . jackson , while a superb actor , is miscast in the role of roman . the actor has become so popular , and so often identified as a protagonist ( notable exceptions can be found , such as in jackie brown ) , that we as an audience have a difficult time believing he will carry out his threats . the script also clearly sets him up as the good guy who is only trying to prove his innocence . how can we believe he \\' s going to shoot a hostage , no matter if the hostage tried to kill him earlier ? unfortunately , this preconception saps the film of some of it \\' s would - be suspenseful moments , and anything good left in those scenes is largely attributed to jackson \\' s acting ability . almost every time he \\' s in a scene , jackson steals it without looking back . when spacey appears , the film has already run about a third of its course . his is an interesting character . made out to be some kind of negotiating superman , our first look at him has him hopelessly trying to get his family moving to set out on vacation . \" i can talk a man out of blowing up the sears tower , but i can \\' t talk my wife out of the bedroom or my daughter off the phone , \" he says . when he gets the call to action , however , he quickly changes gears and becomes the man we expect him to be . soon , his character has to negotiate not only with roman , but also with the swat commander ( david morse ) who is itching to send in a team to take roman out , all the while keeping wary of the fbi agents who are waiting to take over the operation , should negotiations fail . this complex set of pressures are reflected well in sabian the negotiator and spacey the actor . as the second protagonist , spacey measures up nicely . gray really lucked out with this cast . david morse as commander beck , ron rifkin as commander frost , and john spencer as police chief al travis are all more than competent , and can hold their own in scenes with jackson and spacey . the only problem is the bit of typecasting that results from these choices : morse played a similar role in the rock , rifkin played the d . a . in l . a . confidential , and spencer played a police detective in cop land . with the level of acting , however , this can be forgiven . also in the supporting cast , paul giamatti as rudy , one of the hostages , is notable for the comic relief he provides . his character is initially so slimy , and giamatti himself just looks so shifty , that you expect to laugh before he even says anything . fortunately , this doesn \\' t distract from the seriousness of the rest of the film , but instead provides some nice breathers from the level of tension which gray manages to sustain throughout . j . t . walsh , as the suspicious internal affairs inspector , clocks in with one of his final performances . sadly , the talented but underrated actor passed away in late february of this year , and the soon to be released pleasantville will mark his last film . walsh appeared in dozens of movies such as good morning vietnam , backdraft , and nixon . for one of his best performances , check out sling blade , in which he plays a mental patient sharing a ward with billy bob thornton . when jack nicholson accepted his best actor oscar in march , walsh was one of the men to whom he credited his success ( the actors performed together in a few good men ) . the negotiator is actually dedicated to walsh , and while inspector niebaum may not have been his best role , it certainly characterizes the type of character for which walsh had become most famous for playing . in the end , the negotiator has a plotline that parallels it \\' s reality . we \\' re served with the premise that two equally deft negotiators are battling each other to resolve the conflict in the manner which will suit each of them best . as an audience , we \\' re also given a situation where two wonderfully talented actors are thrown into a movie , and we \\' d like to see if one will dominate the film . both provide some pretty good entertainment .',\n",

              " ('an american werewolf in paris is a failed attempt to recapture the humor and horror of john landis \\' 1981 feature , an american werewolf in london . where the original had comedy , the sequel has the kind of revolting silliness that can be found in tv sit - coms . where the first installment had chills , this one has sequences that are inappropriately , unintentionally funny . in short , while an american werewolf in london has become something of a minor classic in its genre , the woeful an american werewolf in paris seems destined for late nights on cinemax ( it even has the necessary gratuitous nudity ) . the film opens with a trio of daredevil americans -- andy ( tom everett scott ) , brad ( vince vieluf ) , and chris ( phil buckman ) -- sneaking up to the top of the eiffel tower to drink wine and do a little bungee jumping . soon they have company in the person of serafine ( julie delpy ) , who has decided to end it all . she jumps , but andy , with a bungee cord attached , goes after her , and manages to save her ( at the price of a major headache ) . serafine disappears , but a smitten andy seeks her out . however , once he learns his would - be girlfriend \\' s dark secret , he wishes he hadn \\' t . she \\' s a werewolf , cursed to change into a hideous beast when the moon is full , and , to make matters worse , he has suffered a nasty bite himself . actress julie delpy is far too good for this movie . she imbues serafine with spirit , spunk , and humanity , which gives us an emotional stake in the character \\' s fate . this isn \\' t necessarily a good thing , since it prevents us from relaxing and enjoying an american werewolf in paris as a completely mindless , campy entertainment experience . delpy \\' s injection of class into an otherwise classless production raises the specter of what this film could have been with a better script and a better cast surrounding her . delpy \\' s previous credits include such memorable ventures as krzysztof kieslowski \\' s white and richard linklater \\' s before sunrise . she was radiant , charismatic , and effective in both . given the nature and level of the material she has to work with here , she gets as close as possible to those adjectives . it could be argued that delpy is the only reason to see an american werewolf in paris , but even her most devoted fans should consider giving this one a miss . and if your primary objective is catching a glimpse of her in the buff , check out either killing zoe or the passion of beatrice -- those movies have intelligible plots in addition to breasts . the rest of the cast acts at a level considerably below that of delpy -- which is to say , they give performances appropriate for the screenplay . tom everett scott ( that thing you do ) plays the lead like he \\' s in a made - for - tv movie . it would be kind to call him bland . actors vince vieluf and phil buckman , as andy \\' s friends , are no more impressive . julie bowen ( happy gilmore ) is suitably fetching as werewolf meat . and respected french actor thierry lhermitte has a brief turn as another monster meal . on the technical side , it \\' s all bad news . the computer - generated werewolves look painfully unreal . the creatures would probably have been more believable had they been men in wolf suits . repeated use is made of the \" werewolf cam \" , an infrared wolf \\' s point - of - view approach that \\' s interesting the first couple of times it \\' s employed , then becomes tedious . and the soundtrack includes some alternative grunge rock tunes that clash violently with the on - screen action they \\' re matched to . director anthony waller , who displayed a confident , edgy style in mute witness , stumbles with this material , never being able to make the comedy and horror elements gel . as a result , we get the worst werewolf sequel since the howling ii : your sister is a werewolf . ( i will give waller credit for killing off a dog , though -- something that \\' s rarely seen in movies these days . ) an american werewolf in paris is marginally entertaining in a \" bad movie \" sort of way , but that \\' s a dubious distinction . ultimately , it \\' s an unfortunate effort , for , while it isn \\' t unbearable to sit through , it isn \\' t a howl , either .',\n",

over introduces the film . at least it does until he forgets what he was going to say and gives up . the dude ( jeff bridges ) is described as the \" laziest man in los angeles , possibly the world \" , although he \\' s not so much slothful as he is relaxed . spending the last 30 years with a roach clip in one hand and a white russian in the other , he doesn \\' t have much of a life , but he \\' s having a good time . when asked what he does for fun , he responds \" bowl , drive around and the occasional acid flashback \" . lebowski \\' s passion is bowling . when he \\' s not rolling the ball down an alley towards a strike , things just happen to him . arriving home one night , he \\' s beaten by thugs attempting to collect money that his wife owes them . even worse , they urinate on his rug . the problem is that the dude doesn \\' t have a wife . his assailants realize that their target is a different lebowski when they glance around at his apartment . the \" big \" lebowski ( david huddleston ) is a multi - millionaire and his dudeness lives in two - room squalor . the next day , our ragtag hero visits his namesake \\' s mansion attempting compensation for his soaked rug . the carpet is important to him because it pulls the room together : not surprisingly since it \\' s virtually the only object there . when he \\' s denied any money , he picks up a replacement rug off the floor . on his way out , he runs into lebowski \\' s trophy babe wife bunny ( tara reid ) who offers to perform a sexual act that , according to rumor , is one of bill clinton \\' s favorites for a thousand bucks . the penniless dude wisecracks that he \\' s heading for the cash machine . later he gets an unexpected phone call enlisting his aid in being the bag man to deliver a ransom to bunny \\' s kidnappers . this begins the trademarked coen brothers crimes - gone - wrong sequences . the kidnappers are impossibly inept . the dude and his cronies are even worse . every plan goes awry . you can almost see lebowski \\' s brain churning in slow motion as he tries to figure out the clues . that \\' s the story , but to tell the truth it doesn \\' t much matter . there could be almost any plot and the film would be just as entertaining . the narrative only exists so we can watch the offbeat characters and the quirky predicaments they fall into . the dude \\' s bowling buddies walter ( john goodman ) and donny ( steve buscemi ) look like people you \\' d see on the street but , like everything else in this film , they \\' re not quite what they seem . walter is a vet as stuck in vietnam as the dude is in the sixties . everything that happens reminds him of a situation in the nam . when a fellow bowler crosses the foul line but won \\' t admit it , walter pulls a gun on him until he marks a zero on the score sheet . donny gets precious few words in between walter \\' s screaming and the dude \\' s rambling . when he does , walter shouts him down with horrendous albeit seemingly unintentional bowling puns . donny is \" out of his league \" and doesn \\' t \" have a frame of reference \" . the film is peppered with people for whom the term \" character \" would be an understatement . the big lebowski \\' s daughter maude , an avant - garde \" vaginal \" artist , paints while swinging naked in a leather apparatus like an s & m mary martin . the kidnappers are german techno nihilist bikers . bunny lebowski is a high school cheerleader turned porno star . most impressive is john turturro in his far too small role as a hispanic bowler . as the flamenco music swells , we see him putting on his lavender hose . the camera pans up to an all - purple skin - tight bowling outfit with \" jesus \" ( pronounced with a \" j \" , not an \" h \" ) embroidered on the pocket . he addresses the lane with intense seriousness and one painted fingernail . his tongue slowly snakes out and lovingly licks the glowing bowling ball . bridges works the dude as if he had been living him for decades and maybe he has . i can \\' t think of anyone else who could have done a better job . buscemi has a limited role , but he plays it perfectly . the more that i see john goodman the more convinced i am that he \\' s one of the treasures of our time . it \\' s odd to think that most of the world knows him only as roseanne barr \\' s television husband . more like the coen \\' s \" raising arizona \" than their hit \" fargo \" , \" the big lebowski \" demands an open mind and even more open eyes . a mark of the coen brothers is that even with all wonderful dream sequences and the broad slapstick physical comedy on the screen , much of the humor is subtle and easy to miss . there \\' s so much going on that frequently it disappears before you can see it . walking out of the theater , i felt that the film had something important to say . on further examination , i wasn \\' t sure exactly what it was . \" if you meet jesus at the bowling alley , it \\' s not going to be what you expect \" ? \" when the going gets weird , the weird go bowling \" ? maybe there \\' s no real message . perhaps it \\' s just a roller coaster ride through a hilarious world . maybe that \\' s enough .

              " ('contact ( pg ) there \\' s a moment late in robert zemeckis \\' s contact where i was reminded of why i started writing movie reviews in the first place . we see a scientist , dressed in a silvery space suit , walking tentatively across a narrow walkway leading inside a compact , spherical space pod , unaware of what awaits when the ball literally drops . anticipation , excitement , anxiety , fear -- the audience experiences it all the emotional tension right with the character , nervously , breathlessly eager to see what lies ahead . it is this sense of discovery , the anticipation of which and its accompanying exhilaration , that makes this adaptation of the carl sagan novel such magical , captivating entertainment . jodie foster stars as dr . ellie arroway , a brilliant astronomer who dedicates her entire life to searching outer space for extraterrestrial radio signals . and i mean life -- after losing her entire family when she was young , the only thing occupying ellie \\' s world is this quest to discover life beyond this earth . after dealing with much skepticism on the part of government officials and wealthy financiers , ellie receives her vindication when she stumbles upon an incoming radio transmission from the distant star vega , which includes instructions on building an interstellar transport . from this synopsis , contact does not sound too different to most films about alien contact , but there is a whole lot more to this intelligent film than the sci - fi hook . the alien contact angle generates a great amount of suspense and awe , but perhaps more than anything else , contact is a character study of ellie , whose obsession with empirical , scientific evidence has erased all belief in a higher power . the irony is that , while admitting to having no religious faith , she holds onto her belief in extraterrestrial life with such passion and conviction that it becomes , in a sense , a religion in its own right . it would be easy for scripters james v . hart and michael goldenberg , in trying to paint a positive image of the heroine , to champion her scientific beliefs over religious ones , but they wisely eschew easy answers , giving equal time to both sides , and in so doing depict ellie as not completely sane . in the end , there is no right or wrong , nor is there one side that comes off more positive in the other , even slightly so -- there are just two very viable points of view , each with their own merits , each with their own faults . the complex role of ellie is an actress \\' s dream , and foster , a virtual shoo - in for yet another best actress oscar nomination next year , more than rises to the challenge . she conveys intelligence , determination , warmth , and , in a gutsy move , always on edge . we root for ellie and feel for her , but we also feel at times that she goes too far . contact is clearly foster \\' s vehicle , but others are given their chance to shine in smaller roles . matthew mcconaughey , who receives outrageously high billing for his smallish role , holds his own as the religious counterpoint to ellie , spiritual scholar and government adviser palmer joss ( however , his main storyline , the tentative palmer - ellie romance , is the film \\' s weakest subplot ) . john hurt is effectively creepy as s . r . hadden , the wealthy eccentric who provides ellie with her research funding . angela bassett continues to impress in her bit role as white house aide rachel constantine . most memorable of all , though , are tom skerritt and james woods , who play rival scientist dr . david drumlin and national security adviser michael litz , respectively ; both , especially skerritt , embody these asshole characters that the audience hissed just about every single one of their appearances . zemeckis comes off of his three - year break in top shape . always known as a director of effects - laden extravaganzas , it comes as no surprise that contact \\' s visual effects are quite stunning . the central space journey is more than a little reminiscent of the close of 2001 : a space odyssey , but with more advanced technology at his disposal , zemeckis \\' s voyage is even trippier than stanley kubrick \\' s yet more wondrously pure . and zemeckis doesn \\' t resist the urge to use the always - interesting incorporate - actors - into - existing - film - footage effect , which is every bit as seamless here as it was in forrest gump . effects , however , are confined to only a few scenes and clearly take a back seat to the drama , emotion , and pure wonder , which zemeckis proved to be quite adept at in gump . it says a lot that , in a summer science fiction film such as this , it \\' s not so much the effects that stay with you as it is the drama and the issues that are raised . the thought - provoking , two - hour - plus contact is a much - welcome change of pace from summer no - brainers , but the fact that it is a smart film does not mean that it also isn \\' t entertaining . for all the interesting questions it asks , the film is still what it \\' s being sold as -- \" a journey to the heart of the universe . \" and what a fascinating , unforgettable journey it is .',\n",

              " ('robert redford is very good at playing characters who have incredible , god - given gifts , but are able to act like ordinary people . in \" the natural \" ( 1984 ) , he played the fallen angelic character of roy hobbs , the baseball player who was destined to be \" the best there ever was , \" but still acted like a humble farm boy . in \" butch cassidy and the sundance kid \" ( 1969 ) , he was the most dangerous shot in the west , yet he came off like a nothing more than a boyishly good - looking charmer . even in \" indecent proposal \" ( 1993 ) , where he played a man who was so good at making money that he believed he could buy love , redford was still able to exude an aura of shy decency , especially when reciting a tale of lost love . in his latest film , \" the horse whisperer , \" based on the best - selling novel by nicholas evans , redford again plays such a character . redford also directed the film although he swore up and down that he would never direct himself in a movie - i suppose the character of tom booker , a man who has the amazing gift of understanding and somehow communicating with horses , was just too good to pass up . despite his enormous and rare gift when it comes to training troubled horses ( a magazine article coins the phrase \" horse whisperer \" to describe his uncanny talent ) , booker sees himself as an everyday cattle rancher whose greatest fear is growing old and no longer having a purpose in life . booker \\' s talents are taxed into service by annie maclean ( kristin scott thomas ) , a new york magazine editor whose daughter , grace ( scarlett johansson ) , was recently in a horrible accident . the accident , which is filmed with gut - wrenching horror , happens when grace and her best friend are out riding horses - an eighteen - wheeler kills grace \\' s friend , severely wounds and traumatizes grace \\' s horse , pilgrim , and causes grace to lose part of her right leg . annie believes that if pilgrim can be healed , grace will be healed as well , which leads her to booker . at first , she tries to get booker to come to new york to see the horse , but that doesn \\' t work . instead , she packs up grace and pilgrim , leaves her husband , robert ( sam neill ) behind , and heads for the rolling hills of montana where booker runs a ranch with his brother , frank ( chris cooper ) , and his sister - in - law , diane ( dianne wiest ) . in many ways , the film is like a journey , both literally and symbolically . the move out west has always been a great american tradition of renewal , and it \\' s hard not to see annie and grace \\' s leaving manhattan for montana as a variation on the classic theme of city vs . country . in \" the horse whisperer , \" country is clearly the victor . the city is characterized by claustrophobia and unhappiness , and it is not until the characters arrive in the wide - open spaces of montana that grace \\' s anger at being physically and emotionally crippled begins to dissipate , annie \\' s controlling nature begins to relax , and pilgrim once again learns to trust people . redford is just as in love with the grand montana country in this film as he was when he directed \" a river runs through it \" six years ago . in many ways , \" the horse whisperer \" comes from the same poetic vein as \" river , \" and the movie could probably be a good fifteen minutes shorter if redford had decided to spend less camera - time on the grass and mountains . but then , that would ruin the magic . much of the film \\' s photography is truly elegant , and it creates a palpable sense of the sheer expansiveness of the land . to further emphasize this , redford and cinematographer robert richardson ( \" natural born killers , \" \" platoon \" ) cheated a bit by shooting the beginning of the film - which takes place in new york - with mostly cold , harsh bluish filters and a more squarish 1 . 85 : 1 aspect ratio ; when the action shifts to montana , richardson switches to soft - focus and natural lighting , and the screen widens to a 2 . 35 : 1 aspect ratio . in terms of the story itself , \" the horse whisperer \" gives us the same romanticized view of adultery found in david lean \\' s \" a brief encounter \" ( 1945 ) and clint eastwood \\' s 1995 adaptation of robert james waller \\' s \" the bridges of madison county \" ( richard lagravenese , co - screenwriter here also adapted \" bridges \" ) . although \" the horse whisperer \" has a strong romantic sensibility , i still find something oddly troubling about this kind of story . it seems to me that there should be some sympathy for the husband who \\' s being left behind for this brief , heart - sweeping affair , but there rarely is . in \" the horse whisperer , \" the thankless role of being the fuddy - duddy husband falls to sam neill . he plays the character as a decent , hard - working man who is a good husband and father ; his only failure is that he loves his wife more than she loves him . he is at risk of losing annie to booker not because he did anything to drive her away , but simply because he happens to be a normal , fairly uninspiring man . there is one scene that is particularly telling of how the movie feels about each character . it shows booker and robert going into a horse pen - booker is dressed like a classic cowboy with hat and all , while robert looks somewhat frumpy and out - of - place in a baseball cap . as they enter the pen , booker assuredly swings over the fence , while robert hesitates , then opens the gate and , in a goofy moment , forgets to close it behind him . it \\' s a small scene , but it clearly demonstrates the movie \\' s thorough love of the booker character for his romantic roughness . after all , booker represents everything good about the city while robert represents everything banal and unnatural about it . the best scenes in \" the horse whisperer \" tend to involve not the building romance between booker and annie , but rather the healing process of grace and her horse . although booker \\' s horse - training methods are mythical and unrealistic , the scenes with him and pilgrim are strangely mesmerizing . these are paralleled by the scenes between him and grace , some of which are humorous , and all of which are tender and true . at some point , i wished the movie would drop the whole romance angle and focus on grace more . nevertheless , redford is obviously a romantic at heart , and he brings a light touch to the erotic moments in the film . there are no dramatic sex scenes , but there is a moving scene when he and scott thomas are slow - dancing , always moving ever closer together , that is far more erotic than any scene of sweaty bodies grinding together . although the movie is longer than it should be and is essentially a melodramatic tearjerker with an unsatisfying conclusion that guarantees unhappiness for just about every character , there are enough moments like that which make \" the horse whisperer \" worth the price of admission .',\n",

( gee , we haven \\' t seen that in a movie before . ) arnold the absentee father becomes convinced that the only way to buy back his son \\' s affection is to get him a turboman doll , which his wife ( rita wilson , who will never be the breadwinner of the hanks household choosing roles like this ) told him to get weeks ago . so arnold sets out to find a turboman , which turns out to be more rare than the tickle me elmo was when jingle all the way came out . let me back up for a minute here -- arnold \\' s kid is totally obsessed with this turboman character , which is unhealthy beyond belief . watches the show , eats the cereal , sleeps on the freakin \\' turboman sheets . i \\' d try to discourage any further obsession myself , lest any kid seeing this movie think it \\' s a wonderful thing to con your dad into racing out to buy you any toy you want . but nooooo , the climax of jingle all the way has arnold dressed up as turboman in a parade , exonerating himself of all wrongdoing in the eyes of wife and son , who don \\' t recognize him until the last minute . this is a sad movie all the way through , but it only gets worse after the opening scenes of arnold and mailman sinbad stampeding through a store , racing off to the mall and hooking up with a santa ( jim belushi ) who runs a bootleg toy factory . most painful to watch is a scene at a radio station , where sinbad holds off the cops with a letter bomb after beating up the deejay ( an embarrassed martin mull ) who said he was giving away a turboman doll . capitalism has produced some pretty evil things ( chia pets ) , but this ode to excess and violent consumerism is one of the most shameful . never mind the subplot with perfect neighbor phil hartman trying to seduce wilson while arnold is off shopping ( \" your cookies are incredible \" ) , it \\' s the main plot of the movie that sends the message that it \\' s okay to do whatever it takes to get your hands on what you want . maybe that \\' s what christmas is like at the schwarzenegger house , but not at mine .',\n",

wise , this totally steals from \" kane , \" not only from the set - up ( he interviews three people , and the story is a result of their flashbacks ) , but in other things , like the beginning ( death , then newsreel ) , and smaller details , like the bitter ex - friend in a wheelchair and the bitter ex - wife as a washed - up lounge singer , found in a bar after hours . this is no \" kane , \" and it really doesn \\' t aspire to be : it doesn \\' t attempt to be the deep outlook of something gone like \" kane \" did , and it doesn \\' t really uncover anything poignant about humanity . instead , it uses the flashbacks as a form of contrast between the magic that was the glam rock era and the boredom that was life after glam rock for those who were participants . the 80s scenes are dry and deliriously melancholy , equipped with a performance by bale that is perhaps appropriately dull and unengaging . but the 70s scenes are engaging , though , not to mention addictively campy . they radiate with gorgeous cinematography that nicely accentuates all the vibrant colors of the era , and a feel that \\' s so eerily lighthearted that when combined with the then - footage , they become not only a symbol of decadence , but of times when everything seemed so simple . instead of creating the world the way it was , haynes paints their own world as if it were a narcotic fairy tale : the glam rock movement was full of so much freedom and liberation that after you \\' ve experienced it , everything else seems so mundane . there \\' s no outside world to speak of , secluding these people inside a protective globe that will eventually crack . haynes focuses his story on the tale of blade and the other fictitious rock hero , curt wild , and their relationship that created , molded , and then brought down the movement , reducing everyone else who contributed to it as merely that - contributors . blade - played with reserve by the pouty jonathan rhys meyers - and wild - played with anarchic wildness by ewan mcgregor - are little more than thinly disguised recreations of david bowie and iggy pop , respectively , complete with the creation of a ziggy stardust persona named maxwell demon and the confirmation that the two rock stars may have very well not only have been one - time partners in music , but also partners in bed . through discussions with slade \\' s ex - manager cecil ( michael feast ) , ex - wife mandy ( toni collette , reinventing herself as an american blonde dish who fakes a british accent when with slade ) , and finally ex - partner wild , journalist stuart begins to remember his own experiences in the era , like his discovery of his rebelliousness cum conformity , including the moment when he began questioning his own sexuality ( when he opens up his first slade record , he finds a naked and green slade lying on a crimson blanket ) , and finally running away from home to be part of the london scene , finally resulting in leading a boring job in america . haynes demonstrates that he \\' s quite the visual auteur , molding scenes that are like long heald breaths , such as a seemingly long sequence juxtaposing a slade / wild concert of them performing a brian eno cover , \" baby \\' s on fire , \" with scenes from a decadent drug party ; and the film \\' s most wow - inspiring sequence , the first concert scene of wild with his band , the ratttz , where mcgregor lets loose so much anarchic steam that his wild iggy - esuqe movements ( including stripping naked ) and screams that the film captures that perfect moment when one discovers a major talent , and another ( slade ) discovers his idle . even the brief music videos , spoofs of bowie \\' s , have a rare visual flair that \\' s pure camp , and which would cause ken russell to drool . the best sequence , though , may be the beginning , following the prelude , a sequence which acts as the middle ground for both the actual being of the movement and the post - movement era . in it , stuart and his mates are going to the infamous slade concert where he fakes his own death , where he kills off his alter ego maxwell demon in what appears to be a real assasination , which brought about the end of the era in one swift fake bullet . with brian eno \\' s famous \" needle in the camel \\' s eye \" playing in the background , the scene has a detached exhileration - the song doesn \\' t seem to be played in quite the same way the other songs are . it has a distance that \\' s hard to put a finger on , and it seems to represent that all this is coming to a quick and sad ending , and when one sees slade in the dressing room before the show , docked in a silver frock with wings and blue hair , depressingly staring into the mirror , it comes off as a none - too - obvious prophecy of the finale in the beginning of the film . this movie \\' s not so much about plot , but more about the way it is presented , making this one of those films which is classified as being \" style over substance , \" a statement which prompts many critics to line up for attack . however , for the most part , the engaging part of this film is not the story but rather the way in which haynes creates this world , by using his sets , costumes , cinematography , and especially the music to play as characters in his film . the music is especially notable . the soundtrack , which is wall to wall , consists of old school glam rock tunes by the likes of brian eno , t - rex , and roxy music , as well as covers by slade \\' s band ( with vocals by thom yorke , and occasionally rhys meyers himself ) , and even newer music by shudder to think that sounds uncannily bowie - like . the cast is rather impressive , but no one really walks away with the film , and no performances are extremely good . although eddie izzard , as slade \\' s manager ( who challenges slade \\' s first manager to an arm - wrestling match to see who gets control of his career ) and michael feast as the first and tragic manager come off greatly , and collette and mcgregor have their moments , rhys meyers and bale are noticably sub - par , neither putting a lot of effort into their respective roles . some of it is at fault with the actual construction of the film by haynes . rhys meyers \\' brian slade remains merely a metaphor for the glam rock era , dying when he turned into a retro - garbo , resorting to a life of salinger - ism , and found in the mid - 70s to be lying around , sniffing coke off the ass of a party girl . in fact , no one in this film is really seen as a person , rather than just as a symbol or composite of a type who thrived during the era . bale \\' s character is an especially tough sell : bitter and depressed by flashbacks to his young adulthood , he \\' s not an extremely personal character , and his cliched experiences ( being hounded by the record store guys for buying a record put out by a \" poof \" ) never help us communicate with him . nevertheless , rhys meyers and mcgregor have the excuses that their characters are not really characters but rather the results of an era that has left them , and others , bitter , part of which helps the film work , since this is a major piece of eye candy . at the prime of the movie , they at least look the role of fashionable leaders - slade with his perpetually - changing , androgonys persona , and wild with his topless and unpredictable image , which clash and fuse into an unstable union . their story - of how slade was so influenced by wild that he adapted it into a similar who - cares attitude crossed with camp - is engaging , without the personal background . the story of stuart , though , is a tougher sell because he \\' s the everyman , and when you can \\' t totally identify with the everyman , your story \\' s in slight trouble . as a cultural rock piece , \" velvet goldmine \" is rather good , but it is merely good . it never totally takes off , although it has moments where it absolutely flies , but then comes back down . it \\' s really nothing more than a bunch of really great moments , surrounded by material that could really be much better . the beginning is captivating but slow , the middle is fantastic , and the ending is not only shallow but worse than that , it drags ( the final half hour not only does it not bring the story to any real conclusion , it could probably stop at any point ) . and did anyone really figure out what the mystery is that arthur unearths ? it almost seems like there was no point in the entire investigation other than to unearth the past , which is commendable but not totally so . still , it does what the oliver stone pic \" the doors \" didn \\' t do right , becoming very insightful to what happened , using the visual style to hit most of the right notes of contrast between what made the era so great to those who lived during it and why after living through such an era that everything else seems half - assed ( i suppose the message is : \" live life , but after you \\' ve lived it , what else is the point when you \\' ll be forced to live with regretful memories ? \" ) . the really superb achievement of this film is that during its flashbacks , it successfully creates for the audience what it must have felt like to be in that era , but with the added perk of knowing the result of all that goes down .',\n",

              " ('and i thought \" stigmata \" would be the worst religiously - oriented thriller released this year . turns out i was wrong , because while \" stigmata \" was merely boring and self - important , \" end of days \" is completely inept on all fronts . it \\' s a silly , incomprehensible , endlessly stupid mess . for a guy like me who grew up watching arnold schwarzenegger at his best , it \\' s extremely disconcerting to see where the big man has ended up . for the first time in recent memory , an arnold action movie ( and \" batman & robin \" doesn \\' t count ) is no fun at all . \" end of days \" is a major stinker . the movie opens in vatican city , 1979 . some catholic priests have observed an ancient prophecy , which says that a girl will be born on that night that satan will have targeted for impregnation . if he impregnates her between 11 and midnight on december 31 , 1999 , the world will be destroyed . the pope orders protection of this girl , though some priests believe she ought to be killed . in new york , that very night , a girl is born to fulfill the prophecy . twenty years later , we meet jericho cane ( schwarzenegger ) , a suicidal ex - cop with a drinking problem . now working as a security guard for hire , he is protecting a local businessman ( gabriel byrne ) , who is actually possessed by the devil . an assassination attempt on the businessman by a crazed former priest leads him to the girl satan is after , christine york ( robin tunney ) . recognizing elements of his own murdered daughter in christine ( including ownership of the same music box , apparently ) , jericho swears to protect her against the devil and the faction of priests looking to kill her . there are so many problems with this film it \\' s hard to know where to begin , but how about starting with the concept ? casting arnold in a role like this was a mistake to begin with . schwarzenegger is a persona , not an actor , so putting him in a role that contradicts his usual strong personality is a bad idea . arnold has neither the dramatic range nor the speaking ability to pull off a character tormented by conflicting emotions . in other words , trying to give him dimension was a mistake . harrison ford , mel gibson , or even bruce willis could have played this role ( they \\' ve all played noble and flawed heroes ) , but not schwarzenegger . there are several scenes that attempt to establish jericho \\' s character ; one has him contemplating suicide , another crying over the loss of his wife and daughter , and even one in which the devil tries to tempt him into revealing christine \\' s location by offering him his old life back . none of these scenes really work , because arnie isn \\' t up to the task . the filmmakers would have been better off making jericho a strong , confident character ( like the terminator , for example ) , the likes of which schwarzenegger has excelled in before . this one isn \\' t at all believable the way arnold plays him . the supporting cast tries their hardest , and only gabriel byrne makes any impact at all . as the prince of darkness , he \\' s suave and confident . he acts like one would expect the devil to act . the problem is that the script has him doing things that make no sense ( more on that later ) and that undermines him as a powerful villain . byrne out - performs arnold in every scene they have together ( including the aforementioned temptation bit ) , but this is problematic when it causes the audience to start doing the unthinkable : root for the devil . byrne \\' s speech about the bible being \" overrated \" actually starts to make sense , mainly because arnold \\' s attempts at refuting it ( mostly of the \" \\' tis not ! \" variety ) are feeble at best . the only problem is , arnold has to win , so in the end , nobody really cares . kevin pollack plays jericho \\' s security guard sidekick and tries to liven things up with some comic asides , but like most bad action movie sidekicks , he disappears after about an hour . robin tunney isn \\' t given much to do except look scared . in fact , all of the supporting players are good actors , but none , save for byrne , is given anything interesting to do . performances aside , it would be really hard to enjoy this film no matter who starred in it . this being an action blockbuster , it \\' s no surprise that the worst thing about it is the script , which starts off totally confusing , and when some of it is explained ( and not much of it is ) , it \\' s utterly ridiculous . why is the devil coming on new year \\' s eve , 1999 ? because it \\' s exactly 1000 years after the year of the devil , which isn \\' t 666 , it turns out . some nutty priest accidentally read it upside down , so the real year is 999 , so just add a 1 to the beginning , and you \\' ve got 1999 ! if you don \\' t buy this explanation , you \\' re not alone . it \\' s convoluted and silly at the same time . the method by which jericho locates christine york is equally ludicrous ( she \\' s christine , see , and she lives in new york , see . . . ) , and if that weren \\' t bad enough , there \\' s plenty of bothersome stuff in this film that isn \\' t explained at all . why can satan kill everyone he passes on the street , but when it comes to snuffing out one drunk ex - cop , he \\' s powerless ? is he impervious to only one kind of bullet ? how come he can \\' t control jericho or christine ? and how did those gregorian monks deal with time zones in their prophecies ? a clumsy attempt at a joke is made about this , but it \\' s never actually explained . usually , this sort of thing wouldn \\' t matter in a schwarzenegger flick ( i mean , don \\' t get me started on the time paradoxes offered up by the terminator movies ) , but this time the plot inconsistencies stand out even more than usual because the action is rarely exciting . there are several predictable horror film clich ? s present in \" end of days , \" complete with the old \" black cat hiding in a cabinet \" bit , not that we ever find out what the cat was doing in there . it gets so formulaic that it \\' s possible for those uninterested in being scared to close their eyes at the precise moment a \" boo \" will come . their predictions will rarely be wrong . the more grandiose action sequences are utterly charmless , partially because we don \\' t care about these characters ( due to the script \\' s pathetic attempts at characterization and setup ) , and also because they , too , don \\' t make any sense . there \\' s a scene where schwarzenegger gets thrown around a room by a little old lady . it \\' s good for a few chuckles , but not much else . supposedly we \\' re to believe she now has super strength by virtue of being controlled by satan , but the script never sets that up , so the scene is merely silly . none of this is terribly exciting , because all the action sequences are so badly framed that it \\' s often hard to tell why it \\' s happening in the first place , not to mention that they \\' re edited in full - on incomprehensible mtv quick - cut style . most of them had me scratching my head , rather than saying , \" wow , cool ! \" \" end of days \" is not only silly and confusing , but it \\' s also distinctly unpleasant to watch . the devil apparently doesn \\' t operate in the more subtle , i \\' ll - convince - people - to - kill - each - other fashion outlined in the bible , but instead enjoys killing people gruesomely in broad daylight . this doesn \\' t only make him an awfully predictable sort , but it also means that not a single scene in \" end of days \" goes by without unnecessarily graphic violence , or the odd kinky sexual encounter ( yet another bit that had me scratching my head ) . if violence is supposed to be shocking , it \\' s not a good idea to throw so much of it into a movie that the audience goes numb . scenes aren \\' t connected through any reasonable means , so a lot of the time , stuff gets blown up , or people get killed , and i had no idea why . reasons ? to hell with reasons ! let \\' s just blow stuff up ! isn \\' t it cool ? nope , not by a long shot . this film is thoroughly unwatchable . it \\' s dull , interminable , and unrelenting in its stupidity . perhaps arnold needs to make some movies with james cameron to revive his career , because it \\' s not happening with hack peter hyams here . \" end of days \" might have had camp value , if only it didn \\' t top itself off with an overly pious ending that nobody \\' s going to buy . if the movie is going to be serious , the filmmakers should have come up with a decent script . if it \\' s going to be campy , arnold shouldn \\' t be taking himself so damn seriously ( i didn \\' t actually see him put up on a cross , did i ? ) , and his character shouldn \\' t be such a sad sack . as it stands , \" end of days \" is just a bad movie , and an awfully gloomy one at that .',\n",

not to mention one of the best films of the year . what gives chocolat its magic , much like hallstrom \\' s 1999 winner of two academy awards , the cider house rules , is its willingness to say what \\' s on its mind without holding back to prevent offending audiences . the bold and honest message hallstrom conveys with chocolat will no doubt outrage a select group of viewers , but those who are willing to suspend their bitterness because they feel they are being intimidated or attacked should find themselves to be in agreement with what the film says about narrow - mindedness . chocolat centers its story around the small french village of lansquenet , where majority rules , and the majority lives by only one law : religion . the bulk of the townspeople ( with few exceptions ) are preparing for the sacred time of abstinence , lent , but when the independent thinking , seemingly non - religious vianne rocher ( juliette binoche ) and her daughter anouk ( victoire thivisol ) make the village their home , the people will be tempted beyond belief by the mouth - watering confections in the chocolate shop vianne opens . many are predictably opposed and deeply offended by vianne \\' s opening of the chocolate shop just in time for lent , especially the mayor , comte de reynaud ( a cartoon - like alfred molina ) , who will stop at nothing to put her out of business . on the other hand , the shop is a delight to others , including the cranky armande voizin ( judi dench ) , who sits day by day in vianne \\' s shop , telling the single mother about her unfortunate detached relationship with her grandson ( aurelien parent - koening ) , which comes as a result of his mother ( carrie - ann moss ) believing armande is a bad influence , as she does not hold the same , strict religious beliefs that she does . also a fan of the chocolate is the nervous wreck josephine muscat , whose husband is constantly beating her , to whom vianne offers a home and befriends . juliette binoche is charming and honest as vianne , genuinely capturing her character \\' s determination to turn the narrow - minded townspeople into more happy , independent human beings , but most of chocolat \\' s success is unquestionably a result of the remarkable performances of the supporting actresses . lena olin , previously nominated for an oscar in 1989 , deserves her second nomination for her earnest , moving portrayal of a lost , scared woman torn between staying true to her battering , manipulative husband or leaving him to live the life which for which she longs . judi dench is sharp , incisive , and occasionally greatly touching as armande voizin . carrie ann - moss , in what is likely to be her first largely noticed ( and acclaimed ) role since the matrix , shows a more solid side of her acting skills not previously seen , crafting a character that the viewer both sympathizes with and despises simultaneously . victoire thivisol shows much promise as anouk , a young girl hoping her always - on - the - move mother will eventually settle down . a trade ad for chocolat sums up best the power the actresses have on screen with the tagline : \" five extraordinary women , one extraordinary movie . \" that \\' s not to say the men don \\' t do their share , though : alfred molina makes for a sly and utterly repugnant antagonist , hugh o \\' conor adds quite a bit of comic relief as the priest who seems to not even know why he is who he is , and johnny depp gives a strong performance as the pirate roux , who enters the film late in the game and sparks the romantic interest of vianne . the technical aspects of chocolat are strong across the board : lasse hallstrom directs his enchanting fable with great care , perfectly balancing the elements of each genre to be found within the film . cinematographer roger pratt brings an atmospheric , fairy tale look to the film , and rachel portman \\' s masterful score is her best and most memorable since the cider house rules . chocolat , adapted by robert nelson jacobs from the joanne harris novel , is a wonderful little treat of a film , one that will most likely win over the hearts of audiences and the votes of academy members this winter , and the aggressive backing of miramax films assures the latter . while not as powerful as the cider house rules , lasse hallstrom \\' s chocolat is a film which works on all levels - as a drama , a comedy , a fable , a romance , and a fairy tale . and it even lives up to its name : it is delicious to savor the taste of , easy to digest , and , like all excellent chocolate , it is memorable for days afterward . the bottom line : chocolat is pure pleasure .',\n",

g ? s , he finds that things have not turned out as he has envisioned . as he travels deeper into the forest , going from village to village , the story is always the same : the doctors were all killed by either the guerrillas or the army soldiers , usually for helping the other . when dr . fuentes asks a village woman why the army killed one of the doctors , she replies simply , \" because they had guns , and we didn \\' t . \" rational science and all its attempts to cure have been wiped out by the men with guns , because others \\' sickness and ignorance helps them maintain power . dr . fuentes picks up several companions during his journey , all of whom are characterized by their loss . first , there is a young boy named conejo ( dan rivera gonz ? lez ) , who has neither a mother nor a father . next , fuentes crosses paths with a thief named domingo ( dami ? n delgado ) , who deserted the army because he was tired of being jeered into committing murderous atrocities . through his ordeal in the army , domingo has lost most of his self - respect , and defines himself only by his pistol . along the way , the group also picks up padre portillo ( dami ? n alc ? zar ) , a priest who has lost his faith . as domingo is running from the army , so is portillo - he has been labeled a guerrilla sympathizer , and ran away from the village in which he was preaching . last , the group takes on a mute girl named graciela ( tania cruz ) , who hasn \\' t spoken since she was raped two years earlier , her innocence and even her will to live forcefully taken from her . sayles two major strengths as a director - characters and setting - are abundantly evident in \" men with guns . \" ( like many of his films , sayles might have tightened this one somewhat in the editing room , but a longer - than - necessary running time is a sin almost always committed when the director is also the editor . ) he creates fascinating , complex characters , especially dr . fuentes and domingo . their uneasy relationship is also somewhat humorous in context of the film \\' s overarching theme of violence as power - domingo \\' s attempts to control fuentes with his revolver are constantly undermined by fuentes \\' belief that the revolver is unloaded ( at first it is , but later is isn \\' t ) . the setting is also as thick with detail as the rainforest itself . sayles knows how to bring a location to life , whether it be an early twentieth - century coal mining town in \" matewan \" ( 1987 ) or a contemporary texas / mexico bordertown in \" lone star \" ( 1996 ) . sayles is not a particularly inventive director - he likes to let his actors do most of the work - but he and cinematographer slavomir idziak ( \" gattaca \" ) successfully evoke both the beauty and the danger of the central american terrain . sayles also maintains a strong sense of authenticity by filming everything on location in mexico , using all latin american actors , and having all the dialogue spoken in either spanish or native indian dialects . the one exception is a couple of bumbling american tourists who work not only as comic relief , but as evidence of just how clueless the united states is about what is going on a few hundred miles south of the texas border . it would not be a stretch to say that \" men with guns \" is a depressing film . in fact , the two feelings it evokes most are hopelessness and failure . in addition to loss , the main characters are also failures at something , whether that be dr . fuentes failure to change anything through medicine , or padre portillo \\' s inability to stand up and be the martyr he always dreamed of being . nevertheless , it is bleak material sayles has chosen , and he deals with it accordingly . the last shot of the film does offer a hint of hope , even in a world where , as one character puts it , \" nobody refuses the men with guns . \"',\n",

              " (\"` bats ' is an insulting slap across the face for any dedicated horror movie fan . to pull something like this off , you need to have a sense of wit and style , with a heavy dosage of humor to back up the process if the fright factor ever declines . something like the underground worm thriller ` tremors ' had just the perfect mixture of these elements , and in return , the film was tremendous fun . with the notable exception of a wisecracking supporting player , ` bats ' mainly plays it ' s premise for straight - arrow horror . judging by the ridiculous premise , this was not exactly a wise move . the movie attempts to capture the essence of alfred hitchcock ' s ` the birds ' , but fails miserably . done right , it could have been adequately amusing halloween cinema . unfortunately , ` bats ' is a prime example of a formula movie done terribly , terribly wrong . the only thing amusing about this festering pile of guano is in how intelligible the filmmakers anticipate their core audience to be . i will recite the following paragraph in a manner that will reach the audience of individuals to whom ` bats ' is aimed toward . those guys in hollywood have made a movie about bats . these bats are not very nice , because they eat a lot of people . boy , are these bats ugly . they are infected with this bogus virus that makes them super - duper smart . they ' ve got big claws and red eyes and they are not very friendly at all . a whole bunch of people in texas get killed , so a sheriff guy and a scientist lady are brought in to kill the bats . they have big guns and other cool things to fight them with , but the bats are pretty smart , so it ' s sorta hard to do . the bats swoop down and they shoot at them to make they go away for good . but no , ` bats ' is probably too violent for pre - schoolers . the film , directed by louis morneau , should have ventured straight into video stores . on the small screen , perhaps more fun could have been derived with lower expectations . but sitting through this crapper on the big screen is almost awkward ; although at a few moments it becomes a guilty pleasure , the film is poorly written , poorly acted and executed with glaring ineptitude . even the bats themselves are cheesy , and the attack sequences too rushed and jittery to be properly enjoyed . the sheriff in the story is emmett kimsey ( lou diamond phillips ) , who embodies every pathetic stereotype a small - town authority figure usually portrays ( he chomps on a cigar , struts contentedly in his boots , etc . . . ) . the scientist is dr . sheila casper ( dina meyer ) , who specializes in flying mammals and is classified as ` the best in her field ' . meyer uses a lot of technical terms designed to make the movie seem more intellectually capable , but everything about dr . casper is recycled beyond recognition . her memories of how she became hooked on the topic of bats sounds suspiciously like oceanographic student matt hooper ' s tale of how he became infatuated with sharks in ` jaws ' . everything revolving around ` bats ' is tired drivel , which desperately requires some directorial style or acting capabilities to spruce it up . the supporting cast could have been constructed out of straw , with voices dubbed in later . in fact , that may have worked out better in the end . take one glance at casper ' s bat - loathing sidekick jimmy ( leon ) , and you ' ll have immediate deja vu - he ' s the exact same humorous buddy caricature from every other movie , constructed specifically for timed comic relief . unfortunately , none of his comic interludes are funny . in the role of deranged mad scientist dr . mccabe , the reliable bob gunton gets cornered with the most hideously idiotic character in the bunch . mccabe ` accidentally ' released two experimental test subjects , and the virus spread to other bats . the entire town of gallup , texas is under attack from an enormous swarm of the creatures , but gunton appears to be inconspicuously contemplating something else . something like : ` when is the damn movie going to be over ? ? i just want my money . ' the bats are ugly , i must say . there ' s the occasional moment where they look moderately convincing , but mainly , the swarm is represented in cheesy digital imagery . only bits of the bloody action even hint at the campy fun the film could have been , but by the absurdly stupid climax , it ' s way too late in the game for a decent recovery . characters experiment in slaughtering the bats with gunfire . let ' s explore the logic there : is this really a very efficient way to decrease the bat population ? ? you could empty an entire clip at the flying winged serpents and not even wound one , and after that there are only 18 , 000 more of them . this kind of behavior represents the regular level of intelligence behind ` bats ' .\",\n",

              " ('showgirls is the second major outing for the production team of pual verhoeven , director , and joe eszterhas , writer . their last effort , basic instinct , played like the most sumptuous of classic hitchcock , with a dash of raw sex and sensuality that made it come across with a hit like curry - spiced tabasco sauce ; a dish not to everyone \\' s taste , but certainly a well - crafted movie . possibly that movie \\' s greatest strength was that the most important events happened offstage , prior to the movie , during the movie , and after the movie . . . and that , after bringing all the plotlines together neatly , it left the viewer with full knowledge of what * would * happen in the characters \\' future , so there was no need to film it . there was actually about four hours \\' worth of screen story there , but eszterhas found ways to get it all on - screen in two , by leading his audience into analyzing what was really going on ; and by still holding their interest with clever misdirection and false trails . the major elements that made basic instinct work so well are present in showgirls . we have attractive , sympathetic , but still highly repellent characters ; we have shows for the eyes and the ears , plotlines that play on several levels , we have beautifully delineated characters who are drawn from life and very believable , and we have a story of an innocent ( who may not be so innocent ) who \\' s trying to play straight , trying to improve her station in life , who slips into behaving the way those around her do . . . but recovers with a flourish , and quits a winner . in this sense , the movie is a bit of a departure for verhoeven , who \\' s not known for treating his characters well ; but nomi , the part played by elizabeth berkley , definitely opts out of the game in a positive way , and we \\' re left feeling good about her future . this is not one of the great movies , but it \\' s far better than we \\' d been led to expect by all the negative pre - release publicity . verhoeven got his first oscar nomination in 1971 , and in the last quarter - century has pushed farther and farther , experimenting with the socially - acceptable limits to movie - making . his most recent three movies , robocop , total recall , and basic instinct , have been a progression of back - door access to american culture , moving from the fantastic through the merely psychotic to the underlying basic drives ; and now he \\' s exploring the sleeze . this movie may be the first movie ever made for which the director \\' s contract contained a specific provision that he would not have to deliver an r rated movie . ( verhoeven had to cut several parts of basic instinct to get an r rating , although his original version is available on video . ) many reviewers have taken the politically - correct stance that any movie which uses naked ladies as scenery is a bad thing ; but they miss the fact that this movie is not about naked ladies , it \\' s about people in an environment where naked ladies are common , and why such an environment should exist . it \\' s about the scum who use other people as power - trip toys , and the need to escape their power . it \\' s about a world where sex is nothing and normal human values don \\' t pertain ; and the lack of sexual excitement and passionate heat in even the most blatant scenes is something of an accomplishment . an nc - 17 movie which isn \\' t sexually exciting says a great deal about the phoniness and emptiness of a social stratum where sex has been robbed of any kind of beauty , power , or value . the one scene in the movie that * could * have been a good sex scene , berkley and maclachlan in a swimming pool , is not exciting , because by then we already know his character is a callous manipulator . if anything , it \\' s a rape scene with a victim who \\' s been duped into cooperation . you don \\' t make a movie about the history of black people in america without using a few black actors ; you don \\' t make a movie about world war ii without a few guns going off and a few people getting killed ; and you don \\' t make a movie about las vegas showgirls without showing a few las vegas showgirls . . . and in an awful lot of vegas shows , an awful lot of ladies wear very little clothing . this is a legitimate portrayal of a rather seamy side of the entertainment industry , in a town where sex is simply a negotiable commodity . showgirls de - glamorizes the las vegas show and sex industries with great effectiveness . nomi is played , in a very good performance , by elizabeth berkley , who gives us a solid picture of a woman with limited talents who \\' s at the end of her rope , desperate to live a life better than the one she \\' s known . she has nothing to market except her body and her limited dancing ability , and is trying desperately not to to be a hooker , trying to be something better than she seems destined to be . when nomi realizes she \\' s gone too far for too little , she catches herself just in time to save the most essential part of who she wants to be . gina rivera plays molly , a dressmaker and costumer who befriends nomi , providing her with what may be the one solid , positive relationship in nomi \\' s entire life . molly is the one who makes the difference , and provides the role model and framework nomi needs to verify the value system she \\' ll be using for the rest of her life , and nomi \\' s feelings for molly are the spur that forces nomi \\' s decision . gina gershon plays cristal , an aging , but still very attractive starring dancer , a reflexively competitive manipulator who \\' s become a villainess by internalizing the ethos of the crooks and scum around her . gershon plays cristal as a cross between ava gardner and raquel welch ; a fading talent made bitter by self - awareness . her character is very well drawn and performed ; in a major scene in a hospital room , she acknowledges what she is , and , in essence , passes the torch to nomi . the relationship between the two of them is the most honest one in the movie , and provides part of the impetus nomi needs to follow a different path . it is no accident that the three important parts in this movie are women of different stripe ; molly is an honest , hard - working person who means well , and nearly dies because she confuses the glitter and the image with reality . cristal is a talented dancer who \\' s compromised her ideals and sold herself to be a co - operating part of the system , exchanging self - respect for the species of stardom that can be had in las vegas . nomi believes she can make it without selling herself , succumbs to a degree , and then realizes she can make it without selling herself , and doesn \\' t need las vegas or its brand of \" stardom . \" the male parts in this movie are simply props ; they exist only to demonstrate and explicate the cultural milieu against which showgirls exist . kyle maclachlan , whose single best previous work was as an inhumanly emotionless cop in the hidden , gives us a nicely reptilian bit of pond scum on two legs , camouflaged as a nice guy . glenn plummer plays a dancer who \\' s working as a bellboy , and provides a bit of alternate perspective . plummer \\' s character is the only one in the movie who \\' s maintaining an interest in dance as a performing art , but even he \\' s succumbed to the cult of manipulation . plummer \\' s character is the closest thing to a sympathetic male character in the whole movie . some of jost vacano \\' s cinematography is fantastic , and one particular delineation of nomi \\' s character alteration , a no - dialog scene using nothing but color changes in the lighting , is utterly terrifying . this movie is rated nc - 17 due to language , sexual situations , full frontal nudity , violence , and probably the costuming as well . i don \\' t see a way this particular story could have been told well without it , and i regard it as a legitimate exercise in movie - making . but don \\' t go see it if you \\' re not in a tough mood ; the only person it \\' s possible to like in this movie ends up in an i . c . u . on life support , and there is probably not one character in this movie you \\' d enjoy meeting in person .',\n",

              " (\"in our time . in our modern world , where the cool rule , it ' s hard to imagine that shakespeare is becoming ' the man ' . and yet - film after film , after film , is based on his everlasting magic . in warner brothers ' latest production , shakespeare is kicking ass to a rap beat , while his magic and intelligence slowly fades away . though the producers of the matrix have vaguely based their picture on william shakespeare ' s ' romeo and juliet ' , its title sequence with a frightening rap song and a black limo making its way through the dark streets of new york , is very hard to associate with shakespeare ' s poetry . the film takes place during a silent war between the two major mafia families in the city - the afro americans against the chinese . the youngest son of a chinese mafia chieftain is found murdered . the afro - americans are immediately suspected , but a peace treaty is signed between the two godfathers . it is at this point that han ( the romeo of the story ) finds out about his brother ' s death . escaping from a prison in china , he returns to united states to avenge his brother ' s fate . but before he can restore justice with his kung fu kicks , he falls in love with a mysterious beauty . the only problem is that she is the daughter of his enemy . . there ' s only a weak echo of shakespeare ' s talent in this disappointing production . and there are more problems besides its title . of course we don ' t call it a deformation of a great masterpiece . we call it ' modernization ' . it seems that the producers fear that the audience will not respond to lyrics , without any car chases and gun fights . this lack of respect for the audience i find very disturbing . kenneth brannagh has already proven that shakespeare doesn ' t need to be updated , because his tales are grounded in the basics of life and human nature . and as long as love , hate , honesty and corruption do exist , everyone will understand and embrace shakespeare . i must admit that i found ' rome must die ' very confusing . i can forgive andrzej bartkowiak , since it is his first attempt at directing . he manages to create an incredible atmosphere and directs with a firm precision . unfortunately he completely forgot about character - and story developments . his latest picture is therefore visually impressive , but intellectually hollow . the love story between han ( jet li ) and trish ( aalyah ) , and the mafia intrigues are undeveloped and simplified . jet li is one of the most amazing fighters to ever hit the silver screen and aalyah has a magical voice . their achievement save this film from being completely braindead , but they are not actors , and therefore can not act . they are nothing more than two celebrities put together . the other actors , including isaiah washington , russell wong , henry o and dmx all give the standard mediocre performances . delroy lindo is the only one that projects a coherent image of reality . but there ' s more than acting to worry about . even with li ' s incredible skills in martial arts , the action scenes ( though technically excellent ) are too long and story updates simply embarrassing . to make a long story short : ' romeo must die ' is not intelligent enough to be a thriller , not sensual enough to be a love story and too serious to be a fun action film . it is certain that bartkowiak would be much better off with o this embarrassing and completely unnecessary parallel to ' romeo and juliet ' , so the film is completely stuck - not sure of what to be . and in the end it ' s nothing . there are no performances worthy of notice , no interesting character - or story surprises . so again , the only good thing about it is its technical achievement . this film can boast of great sound , fast paced editing , solid cinematography and some very well coordinated action sequences . the music is another factor that prevents you from leaving the theatre . it is mostly provided by aalyah ' s enchanting voice and several carefully inserted rap songs by various artists , that create a kind of ' ghetto feel ' to it . but when i think back , it ' s not much i remember from this ' production ' . as in almost every summer movie , there are some interesting scenes , but most of the moments that i remember are associated with massive special effects . it is not a film that will get any attention for its artistic qualities , simply because it doesn ' t have any . for someone who has never read shakespeare , it ' s another popcorn film . for those of us who has , it ' s a waste of money , time and brain cells .\",\n",

note actor , incapable of depth but occasionally showing a little flair . after seeing his latest performance in this film , i ' ve changed my mind -- this guy can act , but he also has that forceful presence that most certainly will make him one of those $ 20 million superstars . here , he plays jack foley , a middle aged guy who robs banks for a living . he does it because it ' s fun , i think , but the film opens with him getting caught because his car won ' t start . he goes to jail -- which is interesting -- only to break out five cinematic minutes later with the help of his friend , buddy ( ving rhames ) . we ' re then introduced to karen sisco ( jennifer lopez ) , a u . s . marshall who , conveniently , is waiting with a shotgun as jack escapes . fortunately , they take her hostage , and she and jack spend some quality time in the trunk together as buddy drives them to safety . the central conflict arises when both jack and karen become obsessed with one another , though their respective jobs make them superficially incompatible . we soon learn that the film is not told in sequence ( and , since this is a gritty crime comedy , flashbacks of pulp fiction should arise ) . at first , i kind of felt that it was a gimmick , but i guess it was a gimmick in pulp fiction , too . it ' s a fun gimmick , though , and soderbergh treats the material with enough humor that everything comes off naturally . i ' ve only seen a few of soderbergh ' s films ( i was impressed both with kafka and sex , lies , and videotape ) , but i think he ' s excellent at what he does . he ' s an artist without making it obvious , and without being pretentious , which is always admirable . he uses tricks , yes ( lots of freeze - frame stuff here ) , but it all adds to the smooth and quirky currents in the film . as i said , clooney is terrific , and he ' s matched by lopez . lopez is , of course , beautiful , but she can act , too . i can sense that she ' s honing in on her skills , for she comes off more natural here than she has in any of her previous ventures ( not that stone gave her much help in the loathsome u - turn ) . the two actors have arresting chemistry with one another -- the best scene in the film , by far , is the seduction scene . the brilliance of this scene is also due , in part , to soderbergh , for he cuts back and forth from their quiet discussion in a bar to the physical act which takes place a few minutes later . the scene is a series of soft nuances and glances , layered upon light dialogue , and the result is one of the better love scenes in recent cinema -- meaningful and engrossing . the supporting cast is strong , led by the always - reliable ving rhames . dennis farina , who plays karen ' s father , is good , as is don cheadle as the profoundly stupid villain . steve zahn , who plays jack ' s nearly - brain dead accomplice glenn , steals all of his scenes ( and that ' s in a film where every scene is already at a high level ) . all of the actors are helped by the dialogue and the intelligently - constructed script by scott frank . out of sight is certainly a light film , although there are a few heavy moments that will linger in the memory . overall , i can recommend it simply as great entertainment . not every film has to change your life , and it ' s nice to see a movie that uses the art to tell a great story and simply to entertain its viewers . as for the book , this film is good enough to make me believe that there might be something in the text worth looking at .\",\n",

, \" and hank is no exception although seasoned movie - goers and those familiar with pullman \\' s oeuvre will find few surprises . much of the remainder of the movie is a smorgasbord of intriguing themes incompletely explored in short - hand fashion . lou diamond phillips , for instance , plays a delightfully sinister and callous dea agent who , while appearing to be casually accommodating to hank , withholds vital information at crucial moments . is he part of a wider conspiracy ? with an inherently powerful , if somewhat tired premise , the film offers by parts a riveting courtroom drama , a prison story , and a potential character study of american teens , their relationship , and what constitutes friendship between them . the result is reasonably engaging and suspenseful , with the girls \\' interaction , hank \\' s investigation , and the various trials and hearings , offering hope for their release , delivering tension -- as does the foredoomed possibility of their escape . if \" brokedown palace \" has a major flaw , it is its creators \\' tendency , like time - constrained tourists , to take frequent side trips down fascinating alleys only to reverse direction half - way down and return to the story \\' s main avenue . and , if that were all there was to \" brokedown palace , \" it wouldn \\' t be a very good movie . but i believe the writers and director were after bigger game and , in this , they succeeded . for the main theme of the movie , like the proffered name of its location , is freedom -- in all its permutations . ultimately , the other sub - themes may be considered window dressing . young and pretty , alice ( danes ) is an old soul ; a wild , streetwise teenager with a thirst for freedom and adventure . presented as a perfect blend of yin and yang , dark and light , is her cautious best friend , darlene ( beckinsale ) . clear - eyed and straightforward , alice is more complex than her friend . she comes from a poorer background , has a reputation for getting into trouble and has lost the trust of everyone ( including her own father ) . whereas darlene \\' s life is \" on - track , \" aimed at college , marriage , kids , a career , a suburban home , middle age and \" fulfillment , \" alice \\' s is uncertain , unfocused , and yearning . one poignant scene in the film shows darlene shouting across an open moat to visitors -- friends and relatives from home , whose lives continue while hers is in limbo . tellingly , alice is present but not included . just as revealing of their different personalities , when alice and dar first come to thailand , the openness and delight on alice \\' s face doesn \\' t read as simple naivet ? ; the way she stands up and stretches as she and her friend ride along in a small boat , reaching toward the sun , she really is drinking in what she believes to be freedom , while \" dar \" remains seated in the shade . \" brokedown palace \" begins with an admission by alice of her guilt in a tape recording sent to hank . however unintentional , it \\' s all alice \\' s fault . she \\' s responsible for persuading her friend to lie to her parents , to sneak away from the safety of hawaii to the perils of thailand , to try the petty scam which places them in the clutches of the evil nick . ( in case one misses this point in the inevitable confusion of a film \\' s beginning , darlene obligingly reminds alice of her culpability in prison . ) dar , of course , is the willing dupe which , in her view , confers innocence . never mind that it was her coercion of a reluctant alice to accompany her to hong kong which placed them in police custody in the first place or that her naive confession sealed their fate . dar is innocent . it doesn \\' t matter . alice is the subject of this movie . she and her journey toward personal freedom . along the way we are treated to an unsympathetic portrait of the shallow american culture which created these girls with their half - baked sensibilities and materialistic goals . in the end , that culture , like its representatives , \" yankee \" hank and dar \\' s father ( a \" man who knows how to grease the wheels \" ) , proves as impotent as its government in the face of the girl \\' s tragedy . thailand \\' s culture , contrary to most opinion , comes off much better by comparison . it amazes me that reviewers argued this point at both extremes . i believe the filmmaker \\' s view was that thai culture is vastly different from the american but not necessarily inferior . the thai ( with the sole exceptions of a corrupt official and a spiteful prison spy ) were uniformly consistent in their behavior and true to their principles . the girls were shown to be treated no better but certainly no worse than the native - born . their prison ( in stark contrast to the probable reality ) was no hellhole , being relatively clean and sunlit . the prison authorities demanded good hygiene , provided medical care when needed , and \" hard manual labor \" consisted of picking grass ! the thai guards were authoritarian ( what else ? ) but certainly not routinely sadistic . as for the thai justice system , the reasoning of the thai judges , during both an appeal hearing and in the film \\' s penultimate scene was devastating in its logic and morality . \\' freedom \\' has many faces and \" brokedown palace \" explores many of them . in the extreme , we have freedom of the body and freedom of the spirit . some settle for the former alone while others remain imprisoned with an entire nation to roam without the latter . but freedom seldom comes without a price . which is why the movie \\' s other tag lines are : \" what is your dream ? \" and \" how far would you go ? \" i believe i could make a good case for the interpretation that the person who attains freedom , incarcerated or not , by film \\' s end is alice . she finds redemption and salvation through the acceptance of personal responsibility . i think the light bathing only her figure among the assembled prisoners in the final scene visually signals that fact . kate beckinsale \\' s character might more properly be likened to the \" released \" temple bird referred to twice during the film , \" trained to fly back to its cage . \" as the thai magistrate observed in the film \\' s climactic scene , the issue was always one of \" character ; \" and the jamaican prisoner made it clear that \" freedom \" is achieved within oneself . if one thinks back over the movie , which character was transformed by their experiences ? increasingly , the cinema landscape seems to have become littered with endless permutations of \\' kung fu woman \\'-- female characters virtually indistinguishable from male action figures . here , at last , is the story of a modern heroine . in reading the many user \\' s comments , i was struck by what seems an unusual phenomenon : whether or not a person liked the movie , almost everyone praised the actors . think about that . when was the last time you came away from a motion picture possibly hating it , but raving about all the performances in it ? do yourself a favor : rent \" brokedown palace \" and watch it with a open mind . there \\' s more there than meets the eye .',\n",

in this sort of plot be a colossal jerk , because it makes it easier to empathize with the unrequited lover . but here the fianc ? is a decent , ordinary guy , and although slim would like to feel anger , he cannot . the fianc ? has done nothing wrong ; the situation is the result of bad luck or bad decisions , take your pick . eight taels has its share of flaws ( the early sequences in america and on the plane to china are especially weak ) , but it compensates with insight . when odds - and - ends tells slim that her future husband wants to move to san francisco , she notes resignedly , \" it \\' s all the same . wherever we go , we \\' ll be in chinatown , \" and her straightforward statement expresses much . there is insight , too , in the understanding of the consequences of slim and odds - and - ends \\' decisions : he to move to america , she to marry a chinese - american . both their choices were perhaps born of impatience , perhaps of a sense that the grass is always greener -- and it turns out that both choices were wrong . but they cannot undo them ; they must live with what they have done . such is life . the movie is tender toward these people , but it offers no false comforts . everything that is right and true about eight taels comes together in one great scene , which is the culmination of the love story . slim and odds - and - ends sit in a secluded spot and talk hesitantly , with the muted pop - pop of fireworks exploding in the night behind them , and it seems the conversation will lead to a kiss . the exchange that follows , and what slim then does , is poignant and perfect : with clarity and understatement , we see two people \\' s lives , their heartbreaks and virtues , summed up in a single moment . yes , the film is flawed , but moments like that justify most of its inadequacies .',\n",

broadway musical must do battle with countless other productions clamoring for attention . i almost missed it . every august , the major studios try to squeeze the last few dollars out of summer moviegoers by dumping all of their shakier offerings on the marketplace at once . i was so busy trying to keep up with national releases like \" summer catch \" and \" bubble boy \" that i passed over any independent film that looked like it would only have a short local run . but an e - mail from a reader asking why i hadn \\' t reviewed the movie prompted me to make a late evening trip to the theater . thank goodness for readers like him . \" hedwig and the angry inch \" is a gender - bending glam - rock spectacular packed with great songs . stylistically , the hook - laden tunes are reminiscent of bowie , \" bat out of hell \" era meatloaf and \" the rocky horror show , \" without ever seeming like imitations . as with \" tommy , \" \" hedwig \" tells a story of isolation , pain and defiance , but without the bloated feel of that beloved , but overrated rock opera . writer - director - star john cameron mitchell and composer - lyricist stephen trask have cooked up a real winner . mitchell stars as hedwig , a singer from east berlin touring a chain of u . s . coffee shops with her pan - slavic band , the angry inch . while the patrons of the run - down restaurants look on in shock , and sometimes horror , hedwig boldly tells the sad story of her life in song . she was once a boy named hansel ( ben mayer - goodman ) , living with his mother ( alberta watson ) and listening to rock and roll on american armed forces radio . life is an exercise in duality for hansel . a wall splits his hometown into two parts . mother describes love as the emotion that comes when you find your other half . as hansel grows up , the duality becomes more pronounced . after initially mistaking him for a girl , a gi from the states ( maurice dean wint ) falls in love with hansel and wants to marry him . alas , hansel will never pass the mandatory physical . mother helpfully suggests a sex change , but the operation goes bad , hence the references to \" the angry inch \" ( yes , i know this part is squirm - inducing , but stick with me - it \\' s worth it ) . several years later , mr . right is long gone and hansel becomes hedwig , decked out in a farrah fawcett - style wig and fronting a band made up of korean women . hedwig finds a new love in tommy ( michael pitt ) , a beatific lad with a unique take on christianity . but tommy does hedwig wrong , stealing her songs and becoming a superstar . cut to the present . tommy gnosis \\' stadium tour is thriving and hedwig is suing him . despite warnings from her manager ( andrea martin ) that she could easily be labeled a stalker , hegwig and her new band , the angry inch , continue their coffee shop tour , shadowing the thief by playing whatever city he is in . if this sounds like a bizarre premise for a rock musical , take a few seconds and consider the plotlines of \" tommy \" and \" rocky horror . \" as hedwig , john cameron mitchell does a magnificent job taking a character that could have simply been a caricature or an icon and turning her into a compelling human being . mitchell has world - class style and vocal chords to match . even though the backstory is unusually strong , mitchell never forgets that the production is first and foremost a rock musical . everything is propelled by one terrific song after another and , trust me , these are full - fledged rock songs , not the over - processed fluff that passes for rock in most musicals . while mitchell remains in the center of the stage throughout the film , there is much of interest on the sidelines . miriam shor does fine work as yitzhak , hedwig \\' s lover and bandmate , conveying a great deal through expressions alone . decked out in a bandanna and a surprisingly convincing beard , she makes a mighty attractive man . as always , \" sctv \" veteran andrea martin is a welcome presence onscreen and michael pitt is beguiling as tommy , the angelic -

              " (\"capsule : one of the ten worst movies ever made . christopher lambert vs . evil ninjas in modern - day japan . . . and nobody wins . the hunted is such a bad movie , so completely inept and so totally brain - damaged that i could almost feel affection for it . i could see myself showing this movie to friends and getting a good jolly guffaw out of it , if it weren ' t also insanely xenophobic and insulting . christopher lambert plays a computer - parts salesman who ' s on business in japan . he meets a slinky young woman ( joan chen ) and has a torrid night of lovemaking with her -- and then manages to witness her death at the hands of an evil ninja clan and their leader ( john lone ) . apparently they had some unfinished business that could only be concluded with her getting slaughtered . since lambert is a witness , he ' s of course the next one to die . let ' s stop and think about this for a second . if lambert were in real life being chased by fanatical devotees to a ninja secret society , he ' d have a lifespan you could only measure with an atomic clock . in this movie , the ninja manage to kill just about everyone except him . i imagine the japanese gods smiled down on lambert and provided him with a goof field that radiates out about ten feet from his body . you know what a goof field is : that invisible zone in which anyone who has intent to do harm to you becomes a klutz no matter what their real dexterity is . this is , of course , only the beginning of the movie ' s problems . lambert eventually finds pseudo - safety with a long - haired modern - day samurai ( yoshio harada ) and his partner -- yoko shimada , who you may remember as lady toda buntaro in shogun . they are the two best things in the movie ; in every scene they have authority and presence , and they actually look like they belong here , even when dressed in full samurai armor and wielding bows . the script doesn ' t know what the hell to do with them . lone , as the bad guy , is zero - dimensional . the only bad - guy cliche he has to wallow around in is the one about how the bad guy always has exotic women dripping off of him . in the hunted , this is elevated to the level of an insulting stereotype . what ' s funny is that the peripheral characters in the hunted are not sterotypes -- there ' s a nice little scene with a tokyo cabdriver , and a girl in a pachinko parlor -- but many of the main characters are unsalveageably hateful . also , the phenomenal instrumental troupe kodo has assembled a superior soundtrack -- get the cd -- that manages to survive despite the drek it ' s been designed to accompany . there is an extended battle scene in the middle of the movie that is almost reason enough to watch the whole thing -- a gory , excellently staged fight on the bullet train that shows some real imagination for a moment , and then smothers it by trying to clumsily re - couple the whole thing with the movie ' s relentlessly stupid plot . by the time we get to the final showdown , with lambert getting to wield his own sword ( which , judging from the ham - handed editing of one scene , was forged in seven hours or so ) , we no longer care . we ' re not even given any definitive information about whether or not one of the key characters lives or dies ! someone once said that the key to good art -- good movies , good books , whatever -- is to start somewhere interesting , end up somewhere interesting , and show respect for the audience all along the way . this movie bungles two out of three , badly .\",\n",

wow . reflection is the biggest killer for this film . their apartment and almost everything in the film casts reflections and the crew can be seen in these , some quite glaringly . one more topic of heated discussion : i saw the \" austin powers \" version , and to be perfectly frank , unless you know where the overlays are supposed to be , you \\' ll probably not see them . two girls standing next to each other look a little suspicious , but i can wait for the unrated version on video to see it the way it \\' s supposed to be . spoilers below : the film itself starts with ( cruise ) bill and ( kidman ) alice getting ready for a little x - mas soiree . they go to a quite elegant party in what seems to be a storagehouse for lighting equipment , which is actually an apartment owned by pollack . bill runs into an old friend from medical school who is now the party \\' s entertainment . soon after , bill and alice are flirting with others at the party , thinking that the other has not noticed . bill is called to help with a partygoer who has had a bit too much of a good time . the next day , bill and alice , casually smoking marijunana in their bedroom discuss the previous nights flirtations . they both discover that they both knew about the flirting . bill starts talking about what women can provide in a relationship , and gets alice extremely angry . in her hazy state , she tells of an opportunity she almost acted on to cheat on bill , not caring about the possible aftereffects . bill gets called away when one of his patients dies , and goes to console his daughter . when his patient \\' s engaged daughter makes a plea for his love and affection , he is struck with images of an affair that never occured between his wife , alice and a naval officer . he sees \" opportunity \" as a betrayal to his wife , and before they can continue , they are interrupted . as he strolls home , he encounters a hooker . seeing another \" opportunity \" arise , he follows the hooker home . they toy around , but before the act ensues , alice calls his cell phone . he breaks the date with the hooker , and heads back out into the night . he passes a lounge and notices that his old medical school buddy is playing , so he heads in . when he meets the friend , the friend reveals that for extra scratch , he plays these strange parties , while blindfolded . bill is intrigued and wants to go to one . nick reluctantly sets him up with directions and a password . what follows this is a short meeting where bill obtains a costume for this party and meets a young girl , leelee sobieski , and her father . the young girl has drawn his eye , but her young age , and the prescence of her father deter this from happening . he gets to the party , which is to say the least , a strange affair . after partaking in some strange \" religious \" right , women and men pair off for the orgy to end all orgies . a woman warns bill in disguise , that he should leave before he is exposed as a fraud at the party . he is detained after a second warning , where he is outed for not being in the group . after getting home , he hides the evidence of his evenings events . unable to carry on in his day , he tries piece the events of the previous night together . in the process , he finds that nick has disappeared , his life is possibly in danger , and the woman that warned him has died . i \\' m trying to save a bit of the film here , it \\' s worth sitting through to get to this point . this is only about 100 minutes at this point . this is a strange film , because despite the events that occur , the film has a strong family message behind it . it will be hard to pidgeonhole this film as a certain kind of a film . it \\' s got sex in it , it has nudity , drugs , and many more immoralistic values . but they all serve to show why they are bad in one \\' s life . i recommend this film highly on many merits . cruise and kidman are rarely together for longer than 5 minutes after the opening scene , and the secrecy that shrouded the film should hopefully be apparent as to why it was kept once you see it for yourself .',\n",

talk among the three white christian males , two of them , larry ( spacey ) and phil ( devito ) , who are veteran salesmen , having teamed together for the last twelve years , while bob ( facinelli ) is a young man who has just recently been hired by the firm and works in the research department . these three are virtually imprisoned in their small hospitality suite waiting to meet the big kahuna , as the focus of this claustrophobic film is on their interactions in the hospitality suite . the three salesmen have different things on their mind that is troubling them and a different attitude to their job , and they are each going through internal changes that are profoundly altering their life . the outstanding cast tries to figure out in their own way what they are doing and why . what comes into question is their opinions on life and death , on god and morality , and on how they make a living . these are tough questions and the truth seems to be somewhere in their sales pitch . their dialogue is acerbic , witty , and analytical . following in the long tradition of salesmen films -- from death of a salesman , the tin men , and glengarry glen ross , as this film tries to get you to see what there is about salesmanship that gets these men high . in this case , it is landing the big kahuna . they each are trying to see why he \\' s on top and why they are chasing after him . what makes this film different than the others , is its blatant religious message , comparing orthodox religion to what they do , as both must sell their product . and how after each one \\' s psyche is stripped clean by the other , there is a pause and some lesson about life has sunk in that is pertinent to each . the goal in the movie is not in literally landing the big kahuna , but in finding out what bill of goods they sold themselves that made them be salesmen . larry and phil have one way of doing things and have no qualms of incorporating a sales pitch as part of their life . bob thinks he is above the fray and he pitches every chance he can get about his belief in jesus christ . his vacuous character and smug outlook on life are covered by a disarming smile and an eagerness for him to prove in his actions the words of jesus he literally believes in . bob is a baptist , who takes a very non - questioning and literal attitude about religion . to just look at another woman and lust after her is a sin , according to the way he reads the bible . when asked by larry why he married his wife , he seems puzzled and can \\' t even say because he loves her , only that marriage is something sacred to him . the contrast in their personalities is stark . larry is all business , he simply wants to close the sale . he comes into the room pumped for the convention , using his attack mode to establish how serious he is about being a salesman . he criticizes phil for being so placid , for getting such a small suite , for having the cheap food tray of carrot sticks rather than the one of stuffed shrimp , and for being burned - out . he tells him to go on a vacation . get a woman . while phil is reflective on where all his best years have gone for him and is contemplating a career change , now that he is 52 and is painfully divorcing his wife , after having lived too lonely a life on the road for too long . he now finds himself suffering from some troubling dreams and questioning what he believes in . he has always been a charmer , shaking everyone \\' s hand , trying to please his clients while trying to make the sale . larry is more aggressive as a salesman , he is always a heart attack away from every big sale . in contrast , bob is only in his twenties and everything seems fresh to him . this is his first time for him on the road . when dick fuller doesn \\' t arrive at the party the salesmen throw , larry becomes confrontational and asks phil if he spoke to the man himself about the gathering . when told that he spoke to the secretary , larry throws a tantrum and is resigned to going back to their home office without the new account . but when they start talking to bob , whom they forced to act as the bartender , they are surprised to learn that fuller did indeed come but was wearing another man \\' s name tag and that bob spent the entire evening consoling the tycoon over his recently deceased dog and then talking to him about jesus . bob then tells the boys about a private party fuller is attending afterwards , and that he invited bob to attend . larry and phil can \\' t fathom how bob didn \\' t make a sales pitch . but they soon take another tact and decide to prep bob on how to get fuller \\' s attention about their company \\' s product as they sent him off to meet fuller , and will await his return in the hotel room . these two sharp salesmen are reduced to waiting for this smug kid to come back and tell them he saved their ass . the irony of their situation is played out in the darkness of the hotel room , as they stay up late into the night trying to make sense out of their lives . these three performers were outstanding , each understanding what their role called for , each coming through with a marvelous performance . the only problem with the film , is that its more of a play than a cinematic experience . but the insightful dialogue and refreshing dramatics , give it an intelligent selling point and make it a good product to see .',\n",

              " (\"martin scorsese ' s kundun , which chronicles roughly the first twenty years of the life of the currently exiled dalai lama , has been criticized for its lack of narrative structure . personally , i don ' t think it needs one : it works perfectly well as a study of tibetan buddhist culture and how communist china . scorsese views the dalai lama the way many tibetans probably do , as a larger - than - life symbol of buddhist spirituality and political leadership : the only glimpses into his head come from several interesting yet oblique dream sequences , but his portrayal is appropriate for a film that concentrates on the political and spiritual rather than the personal . the set design and cinematography are outstanding , and while scorsese occasionally seems to get carried away with the spectacle , it helps to augment the cultural contrast when the dalai lama travels to china to meet chairman mao . political art sometimes succumbs to the temptation to start shouting slogans , kundun does not : it succeeds in delivering its message in an artistically interesting way and without being overly manipulative .\",\n",

is spawn , and if you \\' ve seen the animated series on hbo you \\' ll recall it embodies the lost life of a disfigured man , an individual who has transpired the ultimate punishment : he \\' s been sent to hell . todd mcfarlane , the creator of the spawn comic book , must have had a tough time sitting through spawn , for his creativity and themes about resurrection and loss of identity were all being jettisoned in favor of reliable special effects , style over substance , ambience over anything else . not only does spawn rely entirely on special effects , the story , about a bewildered individual who must take on a group of * bad guys * and * find himself * in the process is realized in such a sordid , incapable manner , it becomes indigestible after a while . every character in this film is lifeless , vacuous and seemingly written by a depressed college student . the story begins , like in every superhero movie in this age , with a man living an idyllic life . al simmons ( michael jai white ) , a government agent / assassin shares the love of his wife , wanda ( theresa russell ) and daughter , has a tongue - in - cheek , wiseass partner , terry ( d . b sweeney ) and is content with the job his boss , jason wynn ( martin sheen ) , provides him . the next element in the film is the part when things go awry . and as expected , everyone turns the tables on poor al . as the two are investigating their latest mission at some sort of biological weapons plant , al is befriended by jason , and dies in a gory and truly sickening scene . inevitably , it leads everyone to the conclusion that he has passed away . hence , jason \\' s mischievous master - mind plan , to ` conquer the world \" is just commencing its initial stages , when al makes a pact with satan himself , agreeing to command the devil \\' s army to take over the world and he gets to see his family again . so , our pal al has been uplifted to hell , and while his transformation from normal guy to spawn takes place , his ol \\' partner terry forms a relationship with his wife . time passes . and now spawn is present in the grotesque inner city , the ghetto where cog ( nicol williamson ) teaches spawn how to utilize his neat artifacts , his motorbike , armor , etc . . . this character is merely a poor man \\' s obi wan kenobi without all the mythological hoopla . now the stage is set spawn , the new ` enemy of evil \\' vs evil . and evil takes the cake , doubtlessly . john leguizamo \\' s deliciously heinous performance as the injurious clown working for wynn is the film \\' s relief point . all this anguish , pain , half - baked themes and putrid action scenes are invisible to leguizamo , who steals the show and derives joy from his character , which is basically a compilation of so - so one liners . and then there \\' s martin sheen . whichever way you look you will find carving boards near his pitying and downright appalling last two years . his selections calls for an immediate firing of his agent . as the megalomaniac boss , his caricature plays like a bad dream out of a b - movie , scrambled , and left in the shelf to rot . this is the man that starred in films such as apocalypse now and wall street . i \\' d never thought i \\' d be saying this , but at this juncture , charlie sheen \\' s career is in better shape . spawn is a movie in which realism , or even an attempt to draw a parallel between the problems of the hero and real life is identifiable . for most of the film the vapid michael jai white consumes his time ogling , jumping through roofs , and performing all kinds of acrobatic exercises which even batman and robin accomplished better . it constantly reminded us we were watching a superhero movie -- a very bad superhero movie . continually the film kept on depending on special effects , and sadly , this is how pictures are being made . perhaps no other movie better than spawn illustrates the deterioration of cinema through computer wizardry . the filmmakers seem to have forgotten every human element possible . the quality of this film is abysmal and insulting . it is perceptible that director mark dippe , attempted to touch the psychological chord that tim burton \\' s batman did touch , the desperation of a man whose life has all but evaporated in one spontaneous act . but bruce wayne had human elements to him . he was pensive , resourceful and had relationships , which made our perspective on him equally human . the character of al simmons seems to be longing for a drastic change , as if he \\' s fatigued about being normal . and as all superheroes , batman , superman , the phantom , they must possess an element of normal civilians to make us think they are extraordinary . none of this is present in spawn . the fighting sequences are weakly executed , the dialogue is penny - dreadful and the art direction an odious duplicate of blade runner \\' s . as an example of this film \\' s vastly creative imagination the writers of spawn decided to include a poor orphan boy who is abandoned and beaten , and then rescued by spawn , so our emotions tend to be a little more sympathetic . admittedly , i did laugh once in the film , and that \\' s when todd mcfarlane showed up in an unexpected cameo as a bum . it is no wonder why so american children grow up with no engrossment for art or literature . besides blaming a large portion of it on the laughable school system , i condemn the other part to garbage like spawn . movies that present no admiration , no captivation , no richness and vague interest in what children are being subjected to . and kids will continue to see films like spawn , simply because they are unable to differentiate what makes an imaginative , wondrous film from an insipid and wasteful one . children are not muppets . and spawn unapologetically targets children .',\n",

              " ('melvin van peebles \\' \" sweet sweetback \\' s baadasssss song \" was a watershed moment in the history of american cinema and the black movement . it was released less than a decade after the civil rights movement had begun and almost twenty years before the rodney king incident . its violent and highly sexualized revenge tale of a macho black hustler fighting back against white oppression and winning was something that had never been seen on an american movie screen before . in style , content , and how it was conceived and produced , \" sweet sweetback \" was a cinematic revolution , whether or not one agrees with its subject matter . van peebles , a black american who first gained recognition by writing novels in france , built \" sweet sweetback \" from the ground up almost entirely by himself . because no studio would dare fund such a film , he was forced to raise all the money himself . the movie ended up costing about $ 500 , 000 , part of which was put up by none other than bill cosby . van peebles cut costs by hiring non - union labor and taking on most of the film \\' s responsibilities himself . he wrote the script , scored the music , edited and directed the film , as well as starred in the central role . he was also a brilliant entrepreneur who always found a way to make an extra buck . for instance , when the mppa slapped the film with a dreaded x - rating , van peebles not only threatened to bring a lawsuit against jack valenti and the mpaa , but he also developed a little marketing scheme : he coined the phrases \" rated x by an all - white jury , \" which he put on the movie posters to help advertise the film . he also printed the phrase on tee - shirts which he had no problem selling . the storyline in \" sweet sweetback \" is deceptively simple . it takes place in los angeles , and van peebles stars as the title character , a tough male hustler of few words who grew up in a brothel , and makes money by doing what he does best : having sex . one day , he agrees to go with a couple of amiable white cops down to the station to make it look like they \\' re bringing in suspects on a politically - charged case involving murder . however , on the way to the station the cops arrest a young black revolutionary named mu - mu ( hubert scales ) , who they proceed to beat viciously . acting out of complete impulse rather than political motivation , sweetback fights back and beats the cops to the brink of death . the rest of the film follows sweetback as he evades the cops on his way to eventual escape in mexico . although the repetition of watching sweetback run gets a little old by the end of the film , this plot allows van peebles \\' camera to roam the darker side of l . a . - the ghettos , alleys , and back - street whorehouses that other films had always overlooked . van peebles \\' entire point in making the movie was to secure on celluloid a vision of the black experience in america that other filmmakers had ignored . at the beginning of \" sweet sweetback , \" he offers this epigraph , which is a traditional prologue used in medieval times when a messenger brought bad news : \" sire , these lines are not an homage to brutality that the artist has invented , but a hymn from the mouth of reality . . . \" van peebles wanted to make sure that his vision was one of reality , not of exaggeration . of course , with today \\' s abundance of rap and hip hop music that sings the same ode to black inner - city life , as well as films by spike lee , john singleton , and the hughes brothers , \" sweet sweetback \" doesn \\' t seem all that revolutionary . it is important to remember that this film must be viewed in the context and time period in which it was made . at that time , \" sweet sweetback \" was so controversial that only two theaters in the entire united states would play it . distributors were petrified of a film that , in van peebles \\' words , gave the black audience \" a chance to see some of their own fantasies acted out - about rising out of the mud and kicking ass . \" of course , once it caught on , it caught on big . \" sweet sweetback \" is now considered to be the film that kicked off the blaxploitation era , although van peebles disassociates \" sweetback \" from other movies like \" shaft \" ( 1972 ) and \" the mack \" ( 1973 ) , because those were financed by big hollywood studios . \" sweet sweetback \" is also the only film deemed mandatory viewing by the black panthers . however , even if when viewed from an african - american perspective , \" sweet sweetback \" is certainly not without its controversies . when it was first released , an article was published in \" ebony \" magazine denouncing the film , while at the same time the black panthers used an entire newsletter to praise it . there have been arguments that the victory for sweetback is really no victory at all - beating cops and then running away to mexico is nothing to be proud of . others have pointed out that sweetback has little to say throughout the film ; he has no political motivations , and therefore the violence and havoc he wreaks is not rooted in fundamental beliefs , but in personal and selfish motives . still others point to the clich ? black potency that stereotypes sweetback as being good at nothing but having sex , illustrated in a scene where he gains the respect of a white biker group by bringing their female leader to orgasm . nevertheless , a movie like \" sweet sweetback \" cannot be made without conflicting points of view . it is a revolutionary movie not because it \\' s about one man \\' s defiance , but because it put front - and - center black issues that had never been dealt with before . until that point , american cinema was an almost exclusively white domain , and with the exception of sidney poitier , all black actors were relegated to specifically black roles that were important only in relation to whites . the fact that \" sweet sweetback \" was a movie by black about blacks , was something new ( in the opening credits , van peebles lists the starring actors as simply \" the black community \" ) . van peebles tells an interesting story that goes a long way toward defining the difference between \" sweet sweetback \" and all movies that had come before it . when the movie first opened , he saw it in a theater next to an older woman . near the end of the film , when sweetback is wounded by the police and stumbling through the southern california desert , she kept saying to herself , \" oh lord , let him die . don \\' t let them kill him . let him die on his own . \" it was so ingrained in her mind that death was imminent for any african - american in a movie who rebelled against white authority , that she couldn \\' t even conceive of the possibility that the film might end with his successful escape . and , of course , sweetback does escape , and the screen fills with the message : \" watch out ! a baad asssss nigger is coming back to collect some dues . \" beyond the political aspects , \" sweet sweetback \" is an entertaining picture , which van peebles always intended it to be . he squeezed every drop out of his limited budget , and produced a film that , although dated now , was technically fantastic at the time . he shot in rough , documentary - like fashion , while also utilizing almost every visual and aural trick his technology would allow him . he makes good use of older techniques like split screens , freeze frames , reversed color schemes , and overlapping images . the only time the film ever looks bad is during the night sequences , because van peebles simply did not have the needed equipment . watching \" sweet sweetback \" more than twenty - five years after its initial release , one realizes that it still has bite . arguments can be made that race relations in the united states have made quantum leaps since the early seventies , but there are still problems that are reflected in this film . but there is more to the film than its racial aspect . the legacy of \" sweet sweetback \\' s baadasssss song \" is not only the plentiful amount of art and music told from the african - american perspective , but more importantly , the work of every artist who has fought to fund and produce that which is important to him .',\n",

              " ('in \" the sweet hereafter , \" writer / director atom egoyan takes us beyond the tragedy of death into the tragedy of living . he shows us how it isn \\' t dying that hurts , but rather the pain of living in the hereafter of death , and dealing with the loss and grief that it brings . on a cold winter day in a small , isolated town in british columbia , a school bus full of children slides off the highway and onto a frozen lake , where it cracks through the ice and sinks . fourteen children die , and numerous others are hurt . for the residents of this small town , all of whose children were on that bus , it is an earth - shattering event that resolutely alters their lives . they have always relied on each other in the past to deal with heartache and pain , but it seems that this tragedy is more than they can handle . alberta and risa walker , who own a local motel and lost their child in the accident , hire an attorney named mitchell stephens ( ian holm ) to bring a lawsuit against someone , anyone for responsibility . the bus driver , dolores driscoll ( gabrielle rose ) , is a kindly woman who loved the children and , although she lives with a burden of guilt , is not held responsible for the accident . the bus seems to have simply slipped on some ice , and there was nothing should could do to prevent it . however , according to stephens , there are no \" accidents \" in life , and someone will pay for this tragedy , whether that be the manufacturer of the bus or the guardrail the bus broke through . he goes through the town , approaching the parents who have lost children , asking them to join the class action suit and find vent for their anger . and , for his work , stephens will receive one - third of the settlement money . however , it is immediately apparent that stephens has little or no interest in the money . he is driven by something else , something deeper that he shares in common with the grieving parents . he has lost a child , too , but not in the same manner . his daughter , zoe ( caerthan banks ) , who once almost died in his arms as a young child after a spider bite , has been in and out of drug re - hab clinics and detox stations for ten years . she calls him on an irregular basis , begging him for money , but refusing to tell him what she needs it for . \" i don \\' t know who i \\' m taking to , \" he tells her . in his mind , his daughter is dead . the lawsuit is , to stephens , not only a way to mend the town \\' s pain , but also his own . however , not everyone in town wants it to happen . billy ansell ( bruce greenwood ) , who was driving behind the bus when the accident happened and lost two children , wants nothing to do with it . he has already lost his wife , and he buries his grief in an affair with a married woman . he doesn \\' t want to talk about the accident , and he sees the lawsuit as nothing more than the unnecessary opening of old wounds . to him , the town should be able to take care of its own pain , and it doesn \\' t need outsiders like stephens getting in the way . central to \" the sweet hereafter \" is the tale of nicole burnell ( sarah polley ) , a teenage girl who dreams of being a singer before the accident turned her into \" a wheelchair girl , \" as she puts it . aside from stephens , nicole is the most complex character in the film , and it is she who ultimately decides the fate of the town and how the lawsuit will turn out . it is also her sad , haunted voice that we often hear on the soundtrack , reading robert browning \\' s poem about the pied piper , and how when he led all the town \\' s children away , one was left behind because he was crippled . obviously , nicole is that child , and she feels somehow betrayed that the rest of the town \\' s children left her alone by dying in the wreck . her situation is further complicated because she is involved in a loving , but incestuous relationship with her father ( tom mccamus ) . there is only one , fleeting scene that suggests this relationship , but it is somehow tied into the final act of the film . of all the storylines in \" the sweet hereafter , \" this is the most complicated and unresolved , although its implications stretch throughout the entirety of the film . egoyan knows that the kinds of questions he brings up have no simple answers -- if any at all -- and he doesn \\' t condescend to the audience by trying to neatly wrap it up . what egoyan has done in \" the sweet hereafter \" is really nothing short of miraculous . in his adaptation of the novel by russell banks , he has made a deeply moving film about a lawyer by transcending the pettiness of law and driving headlong into the deeper meaning of what is loss , and how pitiful monetary and material possessions are when compared to human life . egoyan has always been a talented , but distant and cerebral filmmaker whose work suffered only in that it felt so cold . \" the sweet hereafter \" is quite the opposite ; egoyan \\' s stylistic and narrative structures work brilliantly to heighten the impact of the natural emotion , and draw the audience into the tragedy . \" the sweet hereafter \" seems to contain the combined emotional impact that all his other films lacked . the film is filled with beautiful , subtle performances from all the actors , especially ian holm as the lawyer and sarah polley as the sad child who was left behind . the beautiful , roving camerawork by paul sarossy and the haunting , melodic musical score by mychael danna ( both previous egoyan collaborators ) give the film a visual and aural cohesiveness with the thematic elements . like his earlier films , egoyan weaves together multiple storylines that form a blanketing whole . he works with time as a fluid substance , shifting back and forth between the past , the distant past , and the present with effortless ease . the actual bus wreck itself doesn \\' t happen until midway through the film , but by that time the event has built up so much emotion that egoyan can film it from a distance with no graphic detail , and still have it carry great , devastating weight . because human life has become such a cheap commodity in movies , it is astounding that egoyan can convey so much heartbreak in such simple , direct terms . certainly one of the best films of 1997 , \" the sweet hereafter \" is a deeply rewarding , mystifying , and ultimately human film .',\n",

cio ) and marries him . they open up a successful restaurant , where she slaves away in the kitchen but he gets all the credit for it , even though he \\' s a loafer . one night she catches him in bed with another girl and decides to leave for san francisco . we don \\' t see her in flight , so i can \\' t tell how she handled her motion sickness problem -- unless she flew the plane . she visits her friend \\' s apartment monica ( harold perrineau jr . ) , who is a cross - dresser , blending right into the san francisco scene . to cast away her love for the irresistible toninho , she calls her spiritualist friend and gets her to cast an irreversible spell , freeing her from ever loving him again . her luck changes when a local tv producer cliff ( mark feurerstein ) gets a whiff of her cooking and storms into her cooking class as if were in a spell and presents her with her own live tv cooking show . you can really write the script from here on by yourself . . . as the despondent toninho begins to realize what a good thing he had , but things continue to go bad for him : there is a curse he caused on the fishing in his village , there is no chef to replace his wife , as the restaurant is about to close for good . so he comes to san francisco , figuring he can charm her again . he brings along with him his guitar playing musicians , the ones he used when courting her , when he serenaded her under her window . he sees his wife on tv with monica as her sidekick , the yuppie tv producer chasing after her , and sees that she is no longer charmed by him . when he sneaks on her tv show set and tries to woo her with his musical group and him singing corny love songs to her , the ratings go up and he \\' s hired as a regular on the show . the show gets so big , that the network honchos come onboard , taking it national . but they want to change the ethnic flavor of the show , get rid of monica because he \\' s a freak , have isabella cook with tabasco instead of the brazilian peppers she uses , and they change her ethnic dresses to low - cut vanna white type of sexy dresses . cliff , her would - be boyfriend , acts creepy and sides with the network big - shots , even though he loved everything she did . these tv scenes were not only bad stereotype scenes of tv honchos , they were revolting . it was an insult to one \\' s intelligence . i \\' m sure that i \\' m not spoiling the ending for anyone , when i tell you that toninho reforms his macho ways and together they cook up a meal that breaks her spell of loving him again . if the film wasn \\' t terrible enough , monica and cliff act on their attraction for each other and become lovers . it was so awkwardly done , that it had no sense of truth or humor to it . this film might as well have been made by the same network guys featured in this film , because it doesn \\' t look or feel like an almod ? var film , the type of film it aspired to be , but more like a film that was interferred with from above . its more like a futile commercial film that is more annoying than charming and more dull than chic , as it searches for box office heaven .',\n",

              " ('* * the following review contains spoilers * * \" please someone stop joel schumacher before he vomits into a film canister again and tries to pass it off as a movie . \" -- chuck dowling , the jacksonville film journal i wrote the above sentence in my review for 1997 \\' s batman and robin . apparently , no one heard my words . oh , how i wish you had heard them . oh how i wish someone had stopped him . . . because he \\' s done it again . the plot of 8mm is similar to the 1977 paul schrader film hardcore , a surprisingly decent and engrossing tale . in fact , it was everything that 8mm is not . in the opening minutes of 8mm , we see private detective tom welles ( nicolas cage ) working on a case for a prestigious member of the u . s . government . keep this fact in mind , cage is trusted with an important case , which he solves . he returns home to his wife and new daughter , and even finds time to rake his yard ( keep that in mind too , it \\' s important as well ) . he \\' s hired by a rich elderly woman to solve a mystery . after her husband \\' s death she comes across a film in his private safe . it appears to be snuff film , a sort of urban legend of the pornography industry in which someone is actually brutally murdered for the camera . the woman wants welles to locate the young girl in the film , hopefully to disprove that it is in fact a snuff film . so he sets off on a journey into the sordid underworld of sleaze to discover the truth about the film . the main problem with 8mm is that the whole film is completely pointless . welles is actually selected for the case by the old woman \\' s lawyer ( anthony heald , an actor who always plays the same type of character , that being a bad guy ) . when you first see him , your first instinct is that he \\' s behind the whole thing . the choice of casting does the film in . then , as welles begins his investigation , at times we will see a shadowy figure following him . the only person it could possibly be is the lawyer ( or someone sent by the lawyer ) because no one knows welles is even investigating anything yet . so your first instinct has now been confirmed . then , when it is in fact revealed that the lawyer is a part of the whole thing , he tells welles that he was chosen for the case because he was young and inexperienced ( in one of those ridiculous \" since we \\' re going to kill you anyway , why not tell you the whole thing \" moments ) . but earlier when we see welles being hired for the case he \\' s told that he was hired because he comes highly recommended . huh ? also , when the lawyer reveals himself to be a part of the whole thing , his main goal is to get the film back . so why did he give it up in the first place ? ! the lawyer had the film the whole time , then gave it away to the private detective thinking that he would just give up on the case and return the film ? ! it \\' s totally absurd . . . and this is the screenwriter of seven ? late in the film there \\' s a confrontation between all the main characters , and after a struggle one of the character \\' s guns ends up underneath a car . cage , who has been handcuffed to a bed , is rapidly trying to get to his gun , which is on a table . james gandolfini \\' s character goes for the gun under the car in what is supposed to be a scene of \" suspense \" . you see , the gun is just slightly out of reach from the side of the car he \\' s trying to reach it from , and so instead of going around the car to the other side ( where he can easily reach it ) he just keeps stretching . go around to the other side of the car ! ! this goes on for minutes . then , after cage gets his gun , gandolfini then decides it would be best to go around to the other side of the car . boy , schumacher is really really getting on my nerves . i think the final straw would be when cage returns home , devastated by everything that he \\' s seen on this case , and then is no longer able to rake his lawn ! we actually see a shot of him pathetically poking at leaves in his yard . other things that bugged me about 8mm : one would be the music , if you can call it that . whenever the score starts up , it sounds like techno music , and then this awful indian or middle eastern type music will accompany it . awful decision there joel . another is cage \\' s performance . at this point he \\' s capable of a wide range of performances , either good or bad . for 8mm , he delivers a very wooden one , and only shines when he \\' s interacting with joaquin phoenix ( who gives a great performance as a porn shop clerk with a heart of gold who helps cage with his case ) . you \\' re capable of much better mr . cage . now as for you mr . schumacher . . . i \\' m starting to doubt if you \\' re capable of anything else besides urinating onto the institution of american cinema .
